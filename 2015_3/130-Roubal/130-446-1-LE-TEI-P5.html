					class="numberParagraph">1</span>The term democratic revolution is an oxymoron.
				The leaders of the revolution in 1989 were aware that it was impossible to mobilise
				masses, improvise and keep on surprising the opponent and, at the same time, remain
				democrats. “We, who fight for democracy, cannot be democrats,” Timothy Garton Ash
				thus paraphrased Brecht when characterising the strategy of the Civic Forum.<span
					id="ftn3_return"><a class="notelink"
						title="Timothy Garton Ash, We The People: The Revolution of 89 Witnessed in Warsaw, Budapest, Berlin &amp; Prague …"
						href="#ftn3"><sup>2</sup></a></span> The revolutionariesʼ dilemma in 1989
				was not new and, in different form, is present within every modern revolution. In
				case of anti-Communist revolutions, however, an additional fact played a role: the
				old régimes were equipped with formally democratic constitutions and elected
				institutions. Moreover, with the disintegration of the power of Communist Parties,
				the Communist constitutions and parliaments were often the only means to hold the
				supranational states together. Furthermore, the Opposition had played, for some
				time, a peculiar game with the state when pretending to be taking seriously the
				formal constitutionality and democratic nature of the Communist régime and
				addressing its protests to the Federal Assembly or the Federal Government, instead
				of the Party bodies. Naturally, the constitutional institutions responded by using
				police repressions.<span id="ftn4_return"><a class="notelink"
						title="Cf. ICH, COH, collection Interviews. An interview with Dana Němcová, Prague, March 12, 2012."
						href="#ftn4"><sup>3</sup></a></span> The revolutions of 1989 thus had to be
				(and, at the same time, could not be) not merely democratic, but also
				constitutionally correct. This political contradiction led to constitutional
				improvisations across Eastern Europe. In Czechoslovakia the improvisations assumed a
				particularly imaginative shape in co-optations to parliamentary and other elected
				institutions in December 1989 and January 1990.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph"
					>2</span>Legally, co-optation means an extension of the number of members of an
				institution by electing additional members. Sociologically, then, co-optation means
				integration of a marginal Opposition group into the mainstream. In Czechoslovakia,
				co-optation was used for all three parliaments and national committees following a
				proposal by Zdeněk Jičínský, constitutional specialist and dissident, based on
				roundtable political accords of the second half of December 1989 and early January
				1990. Co-optations were to serve as expedient means to remove politically
				compromised individuals from the representative assemblies and to replace them with
				members of the two revolutionary movements – the Civic Forum and the Public Against
				Violence. It thus entailed two intertwined processes of dismissal and co-optation of
				deputies. The politically pivotal co-optations to the Federal Assembly were
				exercised in two waves. First, on 28 December 1989, a day before the Presidential
				election of Václav Havel, over twenty MPs were co-opted including Alexander Dubček
				who was instantly elected Chairman of the Federal Assembly. Shortly after the
				dramatic adoption of the bill on the dismissal of deputies, early January 1990 saw
				the second wave of co-optations that was far more extensive and introduced over 130
				additional MPs to the Federal Assembly. The change (officially termed
				reconstruction) of both national councils and national committees in larger cities
				proved equally radical. Whilst the co-optations were generally accepted in the Czech
				lands as a pragatic solution, they faced (ineffective) resistance in Slovakia not
				merely among Communist deputies, but also within the Opposition.</p><p><span
					class="numberParagraph">3</span>The following analysis of co-optations is part
				of a wider research into the Federal Assembly in 1989–1992 that explores the
				mechanisms of “self-parliamentarisation”, a process of gradual emancipation of
				legislative vis-à-vis executive power. The study has three objectives. First, it
				follows upon the work by Jiří Suk on the revolutionary months at the break of 1989
				and 1990.<span id="ftn5_return"><a class="notelink"
						title="Cf. e.g. Jiří Suk, “Czechoslovakia in 1989: Causes, Results, and Conceptual Changes,” in Revolutions of 1989. A Handbook, ed. …"
						href="#ftn5"><sup>4</sup></a></span> Using similar methodologies and sources
				(the archive of the Civic Forum) the study attempts to explore one of the side
				corridors of the “labyrinth of revolution”. Co-optations are often deemed to be “the
				ancestral sin” at the beginning of many subsequent failures in the 1990s. Hence it
				is worth exploring what led to the situation and their possible alternatives.
				Second, the very topic of the Federal Assembly and the sources it generates
				(verbatim transcripts of plenary debates, debates in committees and at the
				presidium, as well as interviews with former MPs) offer an additional opportunity to
				approach the revolution of November 1989 from the perspective of the marginalised or
				defeated stakeholders. In contrast with Havelʼs vision of moral and aesthetic
				revolution that destroys all dire and ugly, the struggle for the dominance in the
				parliament sheds light on the reform vision of an “articled revolution”<span
					id="ftn6_return"><a class="notelink"
						title="Valtr Komárek, “Děkujeme, přijďte” [Thank You, Do Come], in Pocta Zdeňku Jičínskému k 80. narozeni…"
						href="#ftn6"><sup>5</sup></a></span> coined by Zdeněk Jičínský with his
				deep-rooted scepticism about the genius of a mass and its leaders. This brings
				together two political times: the dynamic time of the revolution against the
				dragging time of parliamentary democracy. This is also the ideological world of
				those defeated, the MPs who did not want to be merely used and discarded by the
				Civic Forum , but to be part of the changes, fighting for their right to consent, to
				which they were entitled even under the Communist régime.</p></div><div

					</span><span class="head">Cooptation in historical and regional
				context</span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Co-optations fall within
				a particular Czech political tradition under which elections were never used in key
				historical junctures to achieve new legitimacy. In 1918, at the time of the
				foundation of Czechoslovakia, the National Committee and subsequently the National
				Assembly were established as revolutionary bodies of political parties. They bore no
				political continuity with land assemblies and the Imperial Council. After Munich the
				change in geographical and political map was manifested in the so called short
				parliament where members from the occupied regions lost mandates, as did
				subsequently the members from the Communist Party. After the war the main political
				parties recognised the continuity of Presidential office, but not that of the
				parliament. The interim national assembly was thus called by the President by
				decree. Even though the parties were to again delegate their deputies, the post-war
				developments have brought a new understanding of parliament not as part of the
				division of power, but as the supreme constituent of self-government.<span

						href="#ftn7"><sup>6</sup></a></span> The discontinuity proved to be also
				personal: merely ten percent of the former MPs sat in the Interim National
					Assembly.<span id="ftn8_return"><a class="notelink"
						title="Michal Pehr, “Československý parlament po druhé světové válce” [The Czechoslovak Parliament after World War II], in …"
						href="#ftn8"><sup>7</sup></a></span> In February 1948 the Constitutional
				National Assembly did not play any significant role. Afterwards the parliamentary
				Action Committee swiftly neutralised non-Communist MPs using a combination of
				pressure and incentives (a number of them engaged actively in the cleansing within
				their own parties). Until the May 1948 elections no MP was formally stripped of
				mandate, though some had resigned, ten were arrested and over thirty had
				emigrated.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>In 1968, during the debates
				on federalisation, the Czech National Council was established as the counterweight
				to the Slovak National Council.<span id="ftn9_return"><a class="notelink"
						title="Constitutional act on the preparation of federal constitution of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (77/1968 …"
						href="#ftn9"><sup>8</sup></a></span> In July the National Assembly elected

						href="#ftn10"><sup>9</sup></a></span> The Constitutional Act on Czechoslovak
				Federation from October 1968 stipulated that the Czech National Council would be
				extended to 200 deputies by co-optation. The MPs for the newly formed House of
				Nations of the Federal Assembly would also be elected from its midst.<span
					id="ftn11_return"><a class="notelink"
						title="Articles 146 and 147 of the Constitutional Act on Czechoslovak Federation (143/1968 Coll.)."
						href="#ftn11"><sup>10</sup></a></span> Finally, the Constitutional Act No
				117/1969 Coll. again extended the term of parliamentary mandate from the standard
				four years to a total of seven. Particularly, however, it enabled cleansing within
				the parliaments. The Act empowered representative assemblies to strip their MPs of a
				mandate, <span style="font-style: italic">inter alia</span> because “his or her
				activity harms the politics of the National Front.” By the 1971 elections, about one
				quarter of MPs in the Federal Assembly were thus replaced along with nearly one half
				of deputies in the Czech National Council. The Council, due to the date of its
				foundation during the hot summer of the Prague Spring, exerted greater resistance to
				the post-August leadership. All changes derived formally from the mandate, albeit
				quite dubious, arising from the last elections to the National Assembly in 1964. For
				instance, Zdeněk Jičínský, the author of the post-November co-optation, first served
				as MP in the Czech National Council and later also in the Federal Assembly, only to
				lose both mandates a year later: the process ensued without – even formal – voter
				involvement.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>The Czechoslovak model of
				co-optations was not used during the fall of Communism in any of the countries
				within the Soviet bloc. Yet all of them (with the exception of Romania), faced quite
				similar structural issue: how to deal with the constitutional legacy of Communism,
				particularly the legislative power of the parliament.<span id="ftn12_return"><a
						class="notelink"
						title="On Communist parliaments in the Soviet bloc see Daniel Nelson and Stephen White, Communist Legislatures in Comparative Perspec…"
						href="#ftn12"><sup>11</sup></a></span> When the old régime fell, all
				countries within the former Soviet bloc had legislatures constructed upon the model
				of the Stalinist constitution of 1936 (although virtually all of them had been
				transformed by major constitutional changes in the 1970s and 1980s). Those
				parliaments were mostly “elected” in the early days of perestroika. The reformist or
				revolutionary élites had to raise a question whether a Communist parliament is
				actually a parliament and what the consequences are of such a query. Reformers,
				revolutionaries and conservatives included, to varying degrees, parliaments in their
				strategies, and parliamentary officials sought their place on the newly emerging
				political map. Year 1989 thus has not entailed as much a “return to democracy”, and
				certainly not in its interwar shape, but adaptation of “socialist democracy” and its
				constitutionalism to the context of open society. Similarly to the study of
				post-Communist nationalism, this paper also refutes the “freezer” thesis which
				claims that Communism merely froze ethnic conflicts that resurfaced during the
				political meltdown.<span id="ftn13_return"><a class="notelink"
						title="Cf. e.g. Katherine Verdery, National Ideology Under Socialism: Identity and Cultural Politics in Ceausescu's Romania …"
						href="#ftn13"><sup>12</sup></a></span> Similarly to nationalism, Communism
				not merely preserved, but mainly created and constituted political institutions.
				Additionally, Communist parliaments in the constituent republics in federal states
				were able to become (and often became indeed) the main instrument for the
				constitution of nation states. Similarly to disintegration, Communist parliament
				played an important role in the German unification. The East German <span
					style="font-style: italic">Volkskammer</span> that gained new legitimacy by the
				hastily called early elections in March 1990, proved to be a pivotal institution in
				the process of German unification.<span id="ftn14_return"><a class="notelink"

						href="#ftn14"><sup>13</sup></a></span> The method of Czechoslovak
				co-optations, though not applied elsewhere, was one of the examples – and certainly
				not the most radical one – of daring constitutional improvisations at the end of the
				Communist era in Eastern Europe.</p></div><div class="teidiv0"

					class="numberParagraph">1</span>The Federal Assembly that first convened just
				twelve days after the incident at Národní třída, did not play any role in the first
				days of the November revolution. The Opposition also ignored it at first, adressing
				its demands to the Communist Party and the Federal Government. It was Zdeněk
				Jičínský who helped the demand for the “reconstruction” of the Federal Assembly to
				be tabled as early as at the second talk between the Civic Forum and Prime Minister
				Adamec at the Government Presidium on 28 November. Jičínský proposed a
				constitutional bill on dismissal and co-optation of MPs to be adopted along with the
				abolition of the leading role of the Communist Party:</p><blockquote class="quote"
					><p>“...deputies in the Federal Assembly, the Czech National Council and the
					Slovak National Council, and representative assemblies at all levels, who
					compromised their parliamentary pledge and neglected the will and interests of
					the people, may be dismissed from their posts by the representative assembly
					which they are members of. The representative assemblies shall elect new members
					based on nominations presented by the National Front along with the Civic Forum
					and/or the Public Against Violence. The election shall be carried out by the
					representative assembly to which the candidate is nominated.”<span

							href="#ftn15"><sup>14</sup></a></span></p></blockquote><p><span
					class="numberParagraph">2</span>Zdeněk Jičínský presented the demand remarkably
				early on during the revolutionary negotiations. Just a day after the general strike,
				the Civic Forum did not yet have any ambition to enter the government, moreover to
				serve at the Federal Assembly. At the time Jičínskýʼs proposal for co-optations did
				not lead, to political regrouping of the parliament, but rather to its cleansing.
				The aim was to cleanse the parliament and to retain it operability at the same time.
				Jičínskýʼs erudition was manifested in the fact that he realised well before anyone
				else among the leaders of the Civic Forum, the risk of spontaneous pressure on
				resignations of MPs that would end up blocking the parliament.<span
					id="ftn16_return"><a class="notelink"
						title="Zdeněk Jičínský took part in, inter alia, drafting the Czechoslovak Constitution of 1960, and the Constitutional Act of 1968."
						href="#ftn16"><sup>15</sup></a></span> The issue was made even graver as the
				Civic Forum called from the outset for swift resignation of the President: it was
				the Federal Assembly to take over some of his powers.<span id="ftn17_return"><a

					>3</span>Jičínskýʼs proposal was not the only means of cleansing the
				representative corps. The electoral act from 1971 allowed for dismissal of deputies.
				A number of local activists from within the Opposition hoped to use the

						href="#ftn18"><sup>17</sup></a></span> The Civic Forum was also able to
				mobilise the public to exert sufficient pressure upon individual MPs to resign
				willingly. The situation faced by the deputies, particularly those who did not
				represent the central institutions of power, but were to represent the society
				(regionally, professionally, in terms of age and gender) was unenviable. The
				Communist régime used the deputies as one of the means to communicate with the
				public and to control public criticism. The deputies, as members of the Federal
				Assembly, were quite well known within their local context: the public did not
				perceive them as its “representatives”, but those of the régime. At regular meetings
				with voters in their local constituencies particularly during the late perestroika,
				they had to to listen to criticism of the failing régime without having had any
				opportunity to affect the situation. The deputies had no power during Communism, the
				less so during the revolution, hence they lacked political backing as well.<span

						title="Adéla Gjuričová, “Profesionalizace parlamentů před a po Listopadu” [Professionalisation of Parliaments…"
						href="#ftn19"><sup>18</sup></a></span> The Civic Forum did take it into
				account. In a debate on how to make the MPs to elect Václav Havel for President, one
				of the key activists of the Civic Forum stated that there was no danger of any
				resistance on their part: “Such person has neighbours, lives in a neighbourhood, and
				has relatives ...”<span id="ftn20_return"><a class="notelink"

						href="#ftn20"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph"
					>4</span>The issue, however, was that the Opposition did not need a “pure”
				parliament, but an operational one. Following the dismissal of MPs, the vacated
				seats had to be filled again. Constitutional Acts were adopted by a three-quarter
				majority of <span style="font-style: italic">all</span> MPs, not merely of those
				present. Therefore, in combination with the ban on majorisation,<span
					id="ftn21_return"><a class="notelink"
						title="The “minority veto” protected the Slovak MPs from being outvoted by their more numerous Czech counterparts."
						href="#ftn21"><sup>20</sup></a></span> an absence of 31 MPs in either the
				Czech of Slovak section of the House of Nations was enough to curb adoption of a
				Constitutional Act. The electoral law at the time allowed for by-elections, whilst
				also accounting for the possibility of choosing from a number of candidates. Yet
				by-elections, similarly to direct election of the President, were in conflict with
				“partial mobilisation” used by the Civic Forum to successfully marginalise its
				political competitors. The Civic Forum was the only one to manage to dominate public
				urban space and, in the free elections, it faced unnecessary competition. In a
				dispute with Zdeněk Jičínský over whether Havelʼs candidacy enjoyed broad public
				support, Václav Benda, the key figure of the Catholic Opposition, put the point
				accurately: “We are not dealing here as much of with some vague opinion of broad
				masses. In this particular situation it is the active masses who decide.”<span

						title="More on this in Jiří Suk, Labyrintem revoluce [Through the Labyrinth of the Revolution] (Praha: Prosto…"
						href="#ftn25"><sup>24</sup></a></span> The issue, however, was that the
				Civic Forum did not know how to control the voting machine to generate the right
				legislation and, particularly, to elect the right President. Petr Pithart summarised
				the uncertainty quite well: “What was agreed yesterday is one thing, certainly. The
				other matter is how to arrange for the people in the parliament to accept it.
				Because the Party will only tell them two more things: To go to hell and to elect
				Vašek Havel. And they will be casting secret vote! I am not certain whether these
				two instructions might prove mutually contradictory. No one can force and check on

				Forum soon came to realise that, not only did it not know how to make the Federal
				Assembly elect Václav Havel to Presidency, but also that it had been unable to
				prevent the other side from using it. During the second roundtable talks on 11
				December, Vasil Mohorita surprised the Civic Forum when he announced that he would
				propose to the Federal Assembly a change of the Constitution in order to introduce
				direct election of the President. The Communist Party thus took over the initiative
				for a while and put the Civic Forum in a paradoxical situation of a defender of
				Communist constitutionalism and opponent of direct democracy. The Communist Party
				showed that it was also able to reach for “revolutionary” methods. As Zdeněk
				Jičínský emphasised in his response to the proposal, direct election of the
				President would not only be in conflict with the existing constitutional tradition
				of parliamentary democracy, but would be in utter conflict with the spirit of the
				Constitutional Act on Federation of 1968 as it would enable the Czechs to outvote
				the Slovaks.<span id="ftn27_return"><a class="notelink"

					>7</span>The Civic Forum responded to the obstinacy of the parliament by calling
				mass demonstrations in front of the Federal Assembly. At the same time it started to
				speak of the Federal Assembly within the categories of sin and guilt. The dismissal
				of MPs was to become the “most dignified and visible form of repentance for the past
				inactivity of the Federal Assembly, not having prevented the evil. The repentance of
				the MPs at the Federal Assembly may thus be manifested by the swiftest possible
				election of the President.”<span id="ftn28_return"><a class="notelink"

				last days of 1989 the two parties eventually reached a temporary compromise on the

				Nevertheless, the Civic Forum continued to expect to use the model of dismissal of
				MPs from 1969 after the election of the President. Yet it did not mention the
				intention in public or to MPs. During the meeting of officials of the Civic Forum
				and the Public Against Violence on 22 December, Pavel Rychetský, a lawyer and member
				of the narrowest leadership circle in the Civic Forum, explained further approach to
				his Slovak partners: “It would not be appropriate for Dubček to be the only one to

				others so that it does not look inappropriate. We intend to sit down with you

					class="numberParagraph">1</span>Zdeněk Jičínskýʼs role in co-optations requires
				a brief explanatory note. Many authors and stakeholders in revolutions see
				Jičínskýʼs engagement in co-optations as a revenge for the purges during
				normalisation. For instance, the dissident and later Czech Prime Minister Petr
				Pithart suggests that Jičínský “could not control himself” and repeatedly stated:

				within the context of Jičínskýʼs activities during the revolution and afterwards.
				The proposal for co-optations falls not only within his wider contribution to the
				post-Communist transformation of the parliament, but is also part of his own
				specific vision of post-November changes that differed radically from that of Havel.
				As the only one among revolutionary leaders, Zdeněk Jičínský was wholly prepared, as
				a professional and specialist, for his political role of the constitutional expert
				within the Civic Forum. His later right-wing opponents saw him chiefly as the author
				of the 1960 Constitution. Yet his activities in the November revolution benefitted
				far more from his experience in political negotiations about federalisation of
				Czechoslovakia in 1968. When drafting the bill on Czechoslovak federalisation that
				de facto represented a new Constitution, Jičínský tested the opportunities and
				limits of a compromise between the (Slovak) principle of sovereignty and the (Czech)
				civic principle of equality of votes. He also had an opportunity to test the narrow
				limits of Czech understanding of the Slovak issue. Finally, a year later, he
				experienced himself the “restructuring” of the parliament when forced to resign from
				both mandates and his seats were immediately filled by co-optation. Shortly prior to
				November, Zdeněk Jičínský, the author of many texts of Charter 77, together with
				other lawyers participated in developing an alternative draft of the Constitution
				that was to be the answer by the Opposition to the draft developed by the
					Government.<span id="ftn33_return"><a class="notelink"

				experience of a reform Communist who fought the aesthetic-political project of the

				the relationship between the Czechs and Slovaks. During the leadership negotiations

				already been legalised by the Constitutional Act of 28 December. Further agreement
				only concerned its extension to all other levels of representative assemblies. The

				formulation of the bill that enabled the dismissal of MPs who, “because of their
				hitherto activities do not offer guarantees for the development of political
				democracy” was the source of major indignation. For instance, an MP at the Committee

				consulting them with our voters. Yet we hear a voice from everywhere --- weʼve got
				to hurry, fast, fast, fast. Someone is worried about missing something ... One
				cannot make the laws in a hurry.” According to Riško, the Civic Forum followed the
				same script as did the Communist Party in 1969 and it was using the same,
				specifically Czechoslovak method devised to remove potential political opponents in
				the parliament.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>Riškoʼs speech triggered
				an hour-long unscheduled debate. The MPs were competing to dismiss the Communist MP.
				All agreed on that Ján Riško ought to be silent, for he was silent for twenty years.
				With the exception of a few co-opted MPs, the objection applied to all existing MPs
				none of whom could pride themselves in a daring speech to the plenary. Yet most of
				them believed that they secured their right to speak by having consented to the
				post-November developments. “The freedom to consent” was a right that the MPs earned
				by conformity, particularly with the election of the President. The “freedom of
				consent” thus perceived is similar to the understanding of freedom by the Communist
					Party.<span id="ftn69_return"><a class="notelink"
						title="Cf. Petr Fidelius, “Řeč komunistické moci” [“The Communist Power Talk”] (Praha: Triáda, 1998)."
						href="#ftn69"><sup>68</sup></a></span> Nevertheless, the Federal Assembly
				thus destined itself after November 1989 to its hitherto status: one of an
				institution that is clad into constitutional clothes of decisions adopted elsewhere.
				Even though parliaments, including those in democracies, often play the same role
				and the parliament of the first Czechoslovak Republic did largely the same, in this
				case even the right to debate was being denied. Apart from the main line of
				criticism of Riškoʼs speech, a number of additional side issues emerged. Zdeněk
				Jičínský, for instance, argued that the presented bill cannot be compared with the
				parliamentary purges of 1969, as other civil rights of MPs remain intact. Unlike in
				the case of the MPs dismissed in 1969, “no one will prevent Mr Riško to bid for his
				mandate in the free elections scheduled for June” Jičínský stated. He thus indicated
				that he was aware of Riškoʼs dismissal that had already been agreed, even though the
				bill had not yet been adopted. Paradoxically and from purely formal perspective, the
				dismissal of MPs in 1969 was “cleaner” as the right to dismiss was bestowed upon the
				parliaments, and not on political parties as was the case in 1990.</p><p><span
					class="numberParagraph">6</span>Another frequent theme in the criticism of
				Riškoʼs speech and in defence of the dismissal of MPs was a claim that the
				“reconstruction of the parliament” was a necessary step for “the political
				composition [of the parliament] to ideally reflect the political compositions and
				mentality of the people in our country.”<span id="ftn70_return"><a class="notelink"
						title="Address by Mr Stanislav Hanák, MP. Společná česko-slovenská digitální parlamentní knihovna [Common…"
						href="#ftn70"><sup>69</sup></a></span> Such demand was revolutionary indeed:
				it is ultimately more a rule than an exception that the public atmosphere would not
				be in line with the composition of a parliament. That is why elections are held
				after all.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">7</span>After the debate Alexander
				Dubček, being evidently insecure, called the vote. The bill was passed smoothly in
				the House of Peoples, with only nine MPs abstaining. In the crucial House of
				Nations, however, nearly forty MPs were absent. Thus, whilst the Czech section
				passed the bill, albeit with a narrow margin, three MPs opposed it in the Slovak
				section (including Ján Riško), and 22 others abstained. Thus the bill was not
				adopted. Alexander Dubček, who chaired the session and the voting following the
				printed script, first declared the bill adopted. Only after vocal objections from
				the Slovak section, constantly apologising, he started to look for “legislators in
				the know” who would be able to resolve the situation in which the Federal Assembly
				found itself for the first time in its history. After a few intermissions and
				procedural discussions<span id="ftn71_return"><a class="notelink"
						title="See further Suk, Labyrintem revoluce, 289–290." href="#ftn71"
							><sup>70</sup></a></span> a Conciliation Committee was set up for the
				very first time, to be chaired by Zdeněk Jičínský. It was to find a way out of the
				conflict between the two Houses.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">8</span>Prior
				to that, Václav Havel addressed the plenary of the Federal Assembly with nearly a
				two-hour long speech.<span id="ftn72_return"><a class="notelink"
						title="“Projev ve Federálním shromáždění 23. ledna 1990” [Address to the Federal Assembly on 23 January 1990]…"
						href="#ftn72"><sup>71</sup></a></span> It was his first opportunity to
				address the parliament as President. In particular, however, it was a chance to
				present his political-aesthetic plans in the dramatic juxtaposition to the prop of
				the Communist parliament and (mostly) Communist MPs. Havel informed the MPs, who
				were taken aback and whose faith was just being decided behind the scenes in the
				parliament, of the details of his intentions (about his request presented to Sweden
				to return a part of the trophies of the Thirty-Year War, about the “incredibly
				distasteful” bathrooms at the chateau Lány, or about the new uniforms of the Castle
				Guards). His notes were addressed to the television viewers rather than the MPs. In
				his address Havel did not forget to remind the MPs that “it was the old era that
				raised you to your posts”. He also very clearly suggested that he derived his
				authority from the revolution (“the public to which I feel utmost responsibility”),
				and not from the parliament. In conclusion, Havel famously proposed a change to the
				names of the three republics, their coats of arms, names of armies and suggested
				that he expected the parliament to promptly content to his proposals. The Federal
				Assembly postponed the debate on Havelʼs proposals – a decision which is often
				identified as the cause of the “hyphen war”.<span id="ftn73_return"><a
						class="notelink"
						title="The term “hyphen war” refers to a long and complex conflict about the name of the common state in the first half of …"
						href="#ftn73"><sup>72</sup></a></span> Co-optations were among the reasons
				why the debate was postponed. Because of the resignation of nearly one half of MPs
				“the short parliament” between its 22<sup>nd</sup> and 23rd sessions (23 – 30
				January) was unable to carry out even the essential procedural tasks. The presidium
				of the House of Peoples could not reach a quorum.</p><p><span
					class="numberParagraph">9</span>Shortly before 6pm, after the debate on a number
				of additional points, the Houses reconvened to debate the bill on dismissal of MPs.
				Zdeněk Jičínský reviewed the deliberations of the Conciliation Committee. He
				informed that the failure to adopt the bill was caused by the discontent of
				independent MPs with the formal procedure in debating the bill that was unrelated to
				the content of the draft bill. He then appealed to the Slovak MPs who first
				abstained, to assume a clear position either in support of or against the bill. No
				one abstained in the subsequent voting, with only a single MP voting against. The
				parliament did not yet have the voting equipment, what was explicable given the
				hitherto method of voting. It is therefore impossible to estimate the number of MPs
				voting for the bill. Television footage shows that some MPs, such as Ján Riško, did
				not vote at all. The smooth adoption of the bill in the second round of voting
				suggests that the Slovak MPs did not try to block the bill, but tried to firmly
				protest against the misuse of the parliament. They fought for the right of the
				parliament to consent (procedurally accurately), the right to being taken at least
				as seriously as was case of the Communist parliament and, eventually, for the right
				of MPs to consider their hitherto public activities meaningful. After the adoption
				of the bill on dismissal of the MPs the agenda of the 22<sup>nd</sup> session was
				summarily debated. The televised broadcast from the Federal Assembly closed with an
				image of MPs from the House of People leaving the parliament forever, others who
				might return in a week to elect over hundred and thirty new colleagues. The
				sensitive microphones of the state Czechoslovak Television captured their mutual
				farewells.</p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7"><h2><span
					class="headingNumber">7. </span><span class="head"
					>Conclusion</span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The co-optations
				significantly changed the status of the parliament in the post-November distribution
				of power. The institute of roundtable talks disintegrated and the parliament became
				the central (though not exclusive) platform for political negotiations. The
				aforementioned process of “self-parliamentarisation” has accelerated considerably,
				i.e. the emancipation of the legislature vis-à-vis the executive power. The “hyphen
				war” that broke out instantly after the co-optations was thus waged in the
				parliament, and not behind the political scenes or on the street. The side effect of
				the shift from roundtable talks to parliamentary debates resulted in a deep plunge
				in the influence of small political parties within the National Front: with their
				meek parliamentary fractions and mediocre electoral perspectives, they could not
				compete with the far more numerous and prospective parliamentary fractions of the
				Civic Forum and the Communist Party. Together with the outer position of the
				parliament within the structure of the power, the inner running of the Federal
				Assembly as an institution changed as well. Though the co-optations changed nearly a
				half of MPs, the key bodies of the Federal Assembly (the presidium, chairs of
				committees) experienced far deeper change. The two thirds of members of the
				presidium of the Federal Assembly have been changed; the presidiums of the Houses
				have been changed altogether, and the roles of the chairs of the committees have
				been changed by 85 percent.<span id="ftn74_return"><a class="notelink"

					>2</span>The speed of work at the parliament also rapidly increased as the
				legislature convened far more often than under communism and debated far greater
				number of bills. That is also related to yet another internal transformation – the
				development of the rules of procedure appropriate for a parliament that was no
				longer under the oversight of the Communist Party, but one that had to itself
				regulate its internal disagreements. Even though the new rules of procedure were
				only adopted in the subsequent parliamentary term, the change in debating the bills
				followed soon after the co-optations. The initiative presented by Vladimír Mikule
				proved particularly important. He achieved, <span style="font-style: italic">inter
					alia</span>, that each amendment had to be first discussed in the
				Constitutional-Legal Committee prior to being voted on.<span id="ftn75_return"><a
						class="notelink" title="Jičínský, Československý parlament, 91–92."
						href="#ftn75"><sup>74</sup></a></span> Parliamentary mandate was no longer
				an occasional duty or status accessory, but full time job. That also raised the
				issue of wages for the MPs. Political culture has changed substantially. Instead of
				the perfect parliamentary machine of the Communist era with disciplined deputies,
				pre-approved input and careful choreographed sessions, the co-opted parliament was a
				picture of chaos, improvisation and procedural hurdles.</p><p><span
					class="numberParagraph">3</span>Co-optations have been a decisive step on the
				path of the Federal Assembly from the Communist parliament to the liberal one that
				only emerged after the elections in June 1990. It was still the first step, as the
				vital regional principle remained in place until the elections in June 1990 (i.e.
				the MPs represented their constituency). It was also because the Civic Forum was
				shaping itself as a representative body of all social strata without any significant
				differentiation of political currents. It was only the disintegration of the
				parliamentary fraction of the Civic Forum nearly a year later brought the process to
				completion. By giving political parties and movements an opportunity to choose new
				MPs, co-optations also contributed to the introduction of the proportional electoral
				system and created conditions for the emergence of strong party
					democracy.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>From the wider Central
				European perspective, the main consequences of the co-optations in the Federal
				Assembly were the institutionalisation and slowdown of the November revolution. The
				Velvet Revolution that proved unique in post-Communist Europe for its pace, turned
				into “refolution”,<span id="ftn76_return"><a class="notelink"
						title="Ash, We The People, 14." href="#ftn76"><sup>75</sup></a></span> a
				hybrid between revolution and reform. Co-optations, though a specifically
				Czechoslovak method, drew Czechoslovakia closer to other countries of Eastern
				Europe. They created a new political class and, at the same time, helped a number of
				“old structures” survive (if only for short time): the political parties within the
				National Front and some of its officials, the legal system of the Communist
				Czechoslovakia, the constitutional system of 1968, and thus the common state of the
				Czechs and Slovaks.</p></div><div class="bibliography" id="index.xml-back.1_div.1"

					ČEŠKOSLOVAŠKEGA ZVEZNEGA PARLAMENTA V OBDOBJU 1989–1990</span><br /><span
					class="head">POVZETEK</span></h2>
				<p class="docAuthor">Petr Roubal</p>
				<p><span class="numberParagraph"
				>1</span>Češkoslovaški zvezni parlament, ki je bil ustanovljen leta 1969 v okviru
				federalizacije Češkoslovaške, je v žametni revoluciji čez dvajset let odigral
				pomembno in hkrati paradoksalno vlogo. V izpraznjenem oblastnem prostoru, ki ga je v
				paniki ustvarila komunistična partija Češkoslovaške, je zvezni parlament nenadoma
				postal ključna in edina institucija, ki bi lahko zagotovila mirno in ustavno
				preoblikovanje političnega sistema. Opozicijski gibanji (češki Državljanski forum in
				slovaška Javnost proti nasilju) sta sprejeli komunistično ustavo kot podlago za
				preoblikovanje, ustavo pa je bilo mogoče spremeniti samo prek zveznega
				parlamenta.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Ta strategija ni imela
				verodostojne alternative, saj je imel velik del komunistične in pokomunistične
				slovaške elite ustavo in zvezni parlament za zgodovinska dosežka. Druge možnosti, na
				primer vrnitev k češkoslovaški ustavi iz leta 1920, so bile za Slovake popolnoma
				nesprejemljive. Težava je bila v tem, da so bili poslanci zveznega parlamenta leta
				1986 izvoljeni na volitvah v komunističnem slogu, zato jih družba ni imela za
				legitimne poslance. Zdeněk Jičínský, reformistični komunist, eden od avtorjev
				ustavnih sprememb iz leta 1968 in vodilni ustavni strokovnjak Državljanskega foruma,
				se je domislil koncepta »kooptacij«. Nekateri poslanci naj bi odstopili ali bi jih
				odpoklical parlament, ki bi potem izvolil nove člane iz vrst opozicijskih
				gibanj.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>To bi omogočilo odlog volitev,
				utrdilo verodostojnost zveznega parlamenta in ohranilo njegovo vlogo stabilne
				institucije v nemirnem revolucionarnem obdobju. Ta primer ni bil edinstven v sodobni
				češki zgodovini, v kateri volitve nikoli niso bile uporabljene kot rešitev za
				politično krizo. Dejansko je bila za zgled čistka novoustanovljenega zveznega
				parlamenta iz leta 1969 – številni poslanci, ki so bili odstranjeni v tem procesu
				(predvsem Aleksander Dubček), so se čez dvajset let vrnili v parlament s pomočjo
				pravzaprav identične zakonodaje. »Kooptacije«, ki so bile na Češkoslovaškem sicer
				edinstvene, so bile del širšega pojava ustavnih improvizacij v srednji in vzhodni
				Evropi, kjer so se vse države spopadale s kompleksno ustavno zapuščino komunistične
				dobe.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Ta študija je del širšega
				raziskovalnega projekta o zveznem parlamentu v obdobju 1989–1992, ki proučuje
				mehanizme »samoparlamentarizacije«, tj. procesa postopnega osvobajanja zakonodajnega
				telesa od izvršne oblasti. Študija ima tri temeljne cilje. Prvič, nadaljuje
				raziskovanje revolucionarnih sprememb ob koncu leta 1989 in na začetku leta 1990 v
				smeri , katere začetnik je Jiří Suk, ter z uporabo istih metod in virov (prepisov
				pogajanj gibanja Državljanski forum, arhivov Državljanskega foruma) proučuje enega
				od stranskih hodnikov »labirinta revolucije«. Veliko razlagalcev meni, da so
				»kooptacije« izvirni greh, iz katerega so izšle številne tegobe pokomunistične
				preobrazbe v devetdesetih letih 20. stoletja. Zato je vredno raziskati, kako so se
				sprejemale odločitve in ali so bile na voljo tudi verodostojne alternative. Drugič,
				sama tematika zveznega parlamenta in viri, ki jih ustvaril (zapisniki plenarnih sej,
				parlamentarnih odborov, predsedstva ali pogovorov s poslanci), nam omogočajo vpogled
				v žametno revolucijo s perspektive marginaliziranih in poraženih
					udeležencev.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>Boj za nadzor nad
				parlamentom razkriva dva različna pogleda na spremembe: konceptu moralne in estetske
				revolucije Václava Havla , ki bi uničila vse grdo in zlo, se je zoperstavil reformni
				program »paragrafske revolucije« , ki ga je zagovarjal Zdeněk Jičínský ob globokem
				dvomu v sposobnosti množice in njenih voditeljev. Šlo je za trk dveh političnih
				obdobij: dinamičnega obdobja revolucije in počasnega premikanja parlamentarne
				demokracije. Opazujemo lahko tudi svetovni nazor poražencev, tj. parlamentarnih
				poslancev, ki niso želeli, da jih revolucionarna gibanja zgolj izkoristijo in
				zavržejo, ampak so hoteli biti del politične preobrazbe. Bojevali so se za pravico,
				ki jim jo je omogočal celo komunistični režim – pravico do »strinjanja«. To je bilo
				očitno predvsem med nenavadno parlamentarno razpravo o »kooptaciji«, ki se je
				nanašala na vprašanje, ali naj parlament odvzame sedež več kot sto svojim poslancem.
				Prvič v svoji zgodovini zvezni parlament ni sprejel zakona, vendar si je pod
				pritiskom hitro premislil. Televizija je javno prenašala to razpravo, katere
				absurdnost je dodatno poudaril nepričakovan nastop zunanjih obiskovalcev:
				predstavnikov revolucionarnih študentov, ki so zahtevali takojšnjo odobritev
				zakonodaje, Václava Havla, ki ga je ta parlament nedavno izvolil za predsednika in
				je s svojim govorom podžgal tako imenovani »spor zaradi vezaja«, in Franka Zappe na
				parlamentarnem balkonu, ki je snemal dokumentarni film o žametni
			revoluciji.</p></div><!--Notes in [TEI]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading"

					>Frank Zappa worked for the cable channel Financial News Network for some time,
					first as guest (as commentator on the American music and political scene, as
					well as an expert on business in the disintegrating Soviet Union). Later he
					hosted his own show, the Frank Zappa’s Wild Wild East. It seems that, for Zappa
					who unsuccessfully tried to do business with the Soviet Union, the visit to
					Czechoslovakia in January 1990 was essentially an attempt to establish business
					contacts. He thus had Václav Havel appoint him Special Ambassador to the West on
					Trade, Culture and Tourism. That led the US Secretary of State James Baker to
					state wryly: “You can do business with the United States or you can do business
					with Frank Zappa.” On the other side, to Václav Havel and other post-dissent
					politicians the encounter with the prominent figures of the Western alternative
					rock scene was a means to overcome the conflict between their own “authentic”
					past and the contemporary role within the political establishment and support to
					the neoliberal reforms.</div>
