This article seeks to help fill the mentioned gap.</p><p id="index-p-d46e161"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Between 12 August and 4 November 1988, the political weekly magazine <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina</span> published multi-part photoreportage on the political and living conditions in war-torn Eritrea. Produced by the brothers Gorazd and Jože Suhadolnik, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina’s</span> exclusive “report from the ground” ran for ten consecutive issues of the magazine and is regarded as the most extensive photoreportage ever published in Slovenian printed media. The significance of <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Eritreja</span><span id="ftn5_return"><a class="notelink" title="Throughout this text, Eritreja (Slovenian spelling) is used to refer to Mladina’s photoreportage while Eritrea (English spelling) is used to refer to …" href="#ftn5"><sup>3</sup></a></span> photoreportage for the history of Slovenian (photo)journalism lies not only in its unprecedented scope. First, at the time <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Eritreja</span> was a relatively rare application of the genre of photoreportage to report on politically significant international topics, hotspots and events. It is not that these topics were not high on the political or media agenda, but visual coverage of them was scarce, notably of political events and life in the countries of Yugoslavia’s political allies in the Non-Aligned Movement. Such coverage was typically reduced to sporadic spot-news images and protocol photographs of country’s political elites or diplomatic meetings. Due to their scarcity, the few photoreportages which were produced, provide important material for studying the processes of imagi(ni)ng geographically distant Others. Second, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Eritreja</span> is important for its context – it is inseparably connected with <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina’s</span> struggle for greater freedom of public expression during the second half of the 1980s by provocatively challenging taboo topics in socialist Yugoslavia, such as ‘the life and work’ of Marshal Josip Broz Tito and ‘accomplishments of the revolution’, namely, the self-management system, the foreign policy doctrine of Non-Alignment, and the Yugoslav People’s Army (YPA).</p><p id="index-p-d46e190"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>In the late 1980s, tensions started to mount between the federal YPA and the both reformist and increasingly nationalistic political elites in Yugoslavia’s constituent republics. <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina</span> often placed itself at the forefront of these debates, championing topics like civil military service and criticising the plans to increase military spending. The relationship between <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina</span> and the YPA escalated in February 1988 when <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina</span> openly criticised the Federal Secretary of Defence Admiral Branko Mamula’s visit to Addis Ababa, calling him a "merchant of death" for selling arms to famine-stricken Ethiopia. This turned into an open confrontation between <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina</span> and the YPA, lasting throughout the spring of 1988 and culminating in the arrest of <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina’s</span> journalists and editors Janez Janša, David Tasić and Franci Zavrl, along with YPA officer Ivan Borštner on charges of having revealed military secrets. Their subsequent trial before the military court (popularly known as the JBTZ trial), with which the YPA intended to tame Slovenia’s reform aspirations, became a galvanising moment in the process of its succession from Yugoslavia.</p><p id="index-p-d46e207"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Given its position at the intersection of domestic and international narratives, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Eritreja</span> is both a unique and informative example for studying the representation of distant Others. The article commences by situating <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Eritreja</span> within a specific trajectory of the development of photoreportage as a genre within the context of Slovenian (photo)journalism. The main research question considered in the article – <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">How is the Other represented in the Eritreja photoreportage?</span> – is addressed through a two-step multimodal framing analysis. The first step focuses on reports appearing in <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Delo</span> and <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina</span> in the spring of 1988 when Yugoslavia’s arrangements for arms sales to Ethiopia amidst the burgeoning humanitarian crisis had drawn journalistic criticism. In this step, the competing dominant news frames are identified. Against this contextual background, the second step in the analysis focuses exclusively on <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Eritreja</span> and its representation of Otherness. In an attempt to trace the factors influencing the content and look of the published photoreportage, the multimodal framing analysis is complemented with semi-structured interviews with the authors of the photoreportage.</p></section><section class="teidiv0" id="index-body.1_div.2"><header><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head">Slovenian Photoreportage and Imaging of Distant Others</span></h2></header><p id="index-p-d46e230"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Over the past century, Slovenian media has chiefly used the genre of photoreportage for domestic stories, harvesting its visual storytelling potential to create and maintain the ‘imagined community’ of the Slovenian nation. The idiosyncratic development of photoreportage in Slovenia<span id="ftn6_return"><a class="notelink" title="Tomanić Trivundža et al., “Photoreportage in the Slovenian Press.”" href="#ftn6"><sup>4</sup></a></span> is an outcome of constraints in the political context (e.g. pre-war censorship or the post-war, one-party system), difficulties of operating in a small market (e.g. limited resources and audience), the (un)availability of printing technology, the perceived social role of journalism and the status assigned to photography as a means of journalistic reporting. While tracing the main shifts in the perceived role of the photojournalist and of the status attributed to photography within journalism, Tomanić Trivundža, Babnik and Skočir<span id="ftn7_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibidem." href="#ftn7"><sup>5</sup></a></span> identify four major periods in development of photoreportage in Slovenia during the 20th century: <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">nationally-conscious photoreportage</span>, typical of the pre-war period, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">socialism-building photoreportage</span>, characteristic of the post-war reconstruction and social transformation, socialism reform-oriented <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">initiative-giving photoreportage</span>, which emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">watchdog photoreportage,</span> which gradually appeared in the late 1980s and dominated the post-independence journalism in the 1990s and early 2000s. <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Eritreja</span> falls in the category of watchdog photoreportage, which was not solely driven by the desire to “record and show the conditions on the ground”. During the late 1980s, watchdog photoreportage was both a fact-finding and fact-checking operation in which photographs supplied visual proof of verbal accounts. It was initially used in Slovenian media as part of efforts to break out of the information silos of the Yugoslav republican media<span id="ftn8_return"><a class="notelink" title="Yugoslavia’s media landscape was a patchwork of republic-based media which, due to the relative political autonomy of the republics and linguistic obs…" href="#ftn8"><sup>6</sup></a></span> and the official information diet. As the tensions between Yugoslav republics grew, Slovenian media commenced independent investigations of the situation on the ground, initially related to the ‘Kosovo question’ and later to stories indicating the failures of Yugoslavia’s self-managed economy.</p><p id="index-p-d46e260"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Slovenian media’s use of photoreportage for imaging distant Others is naturally closely linked to Yugoslavia’s leading role in the Non-Aligned movement (NAM) and the federation’s associated economic, military, educational and cultural cooperation with developing countries. The media’s interest in using photoreportage as a vehicle to narrate Yugoslavia’s increasingly global economic and political engagement gradually developed in the 1970s and early 1980s, albeit it was by no means a large-scale or systemically supported endeavour. The main news outlets invested in acquiring exclusive information on international affairs, developing their own proprietary networks of foreign correspondents<span id="ftn9_return"><a class="notelink" title="In 1988, Delo’s own network consisted of 10 foreign correspondents and a number of regular contributors." href="#ftn9"><sup>7</sup></a></span> to complement the already extensive network of foreign correspondents of the Yugoslav press agency Tanjug.<span id="ftn10_return"><a class="notelink" title="In 1983, Tanjug had 30 foreign correspondents, including 1 in Addis Ababa. – Velimir Budimir, Tanjug: četiri decenije (Belgrade: Tanjug, 1983)." href="#ftn10"><sup>8</sup></a></span> However, these were investments in journalism of words, not images. Even after Tanjug became the coordinating institution of the pool of press agencies from the Non-Aligned countries (NAPAP) and thus led the movement’s struggle against the domination of information flows coming from Western international news agencies, the resources were committed to independent textual rather than visual news reporting.<span id="ftn11_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ilija Tomanić Trivundža, “Many Voices, One Picture: Photographic Coverage of Foreign News in Slovenian Daily Press (1980, 2004),” Javnost / The Public…" href="#ftn11"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p><p id="index-p-d46e279"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Limited resources meant that much of the published photoreportages in Slovenian dailies (mostly <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Delo, </span>but also <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Dnevnik, Večer</span>) and weeklies (initially <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Tovariš, </span>later <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Teleks and 7D</span>) were ‘marriages of convenience’ whereby journalists were given cameras to supply images for their own stories. Another common type of the reportage was a ‘side job’ produced by professional photojournalists covering official (diplomatic or sporting) events abroad. Professionally produced ‘mission-specific’ photo-reportages were generally limited to sporadic accounts of international conflicts relevant to Slovenia/Yugoslavia (e.g. the Iraq–Iran conflict due to the presence of Yugoslav construction workers in Iraq) or to liberation movements whose struggles resembled or were inspired by the Yugoslav Second World War resistance (e.g. Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, West Saharan Polisario Front). These exclusive journalistic accounts typically succeeded in presenting the topic to domestic audiences from a distinctly Slovenian/Yugoslav perspective, although the extent to which they offered an immersive visual experience of the situation in the field and a ‘home-grown’ representation of distant Others is debatable. In part, this was a result of the limited frequency and space given to photoreportage. Even more importantly, it may be attributed to the restricted selection of topics (conflict and official politics) and their visual style. Unlike the genre’s earlier post-war applications in the magazine <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Tovariš</span>, the photoreportages in question did not follow a clear formal template, such as the array of different types of shots and motives, or used the more engaged, personal or even artistic approach typically fostered in the genre.<span id="ftn12_return"><a class="notelink" title="Stylistically, they were closer to the ‘home-grown’ style of news photography.

In total, 25 articles from <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Delo</span> and 24 from <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina</span> were analysed. For <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Delo</span>, a database of articles published between December 1987<span id="ftn16_return"><a class="notelink" title="Although the controversy started in February 1988, the sample was extended to cover Mengistu Haile Mariam’s visit to Yugoslavia in December 1987 durin…" href="#ftn16"><sup>14</sup></a></span> and May 1988 was searched using designated keywords (Ethiopia, Eritrea, Avgust Pudgar, Branko Mamula, Mladina) and the articles directly relating to the arms-trade affair and conflict in Ethiopia were selected for further analysis. The search for topic-related articles in <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina</span> was manual and covered the period from December 1987 to December 1988. Qualitative interpretation of text and images, salient keywords, metaphors, labels, and an evaluation of actors and actions were conducted on the levels of topical and event-specific frames.<span id="ftn17_return"><a class="notelink" title="Stephen Reese, “Finding frames in a web of culture: The case of the war on terror,” in: Doing news framing analysis, eds.

In the 700-word-long text entitled <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Admiral in the midst of hunger</span>,<span id="ftn18_return"><a class="notelink" title="Avgust Pudgar, “Admiral sredi lakote,” Delo 4 February 1988, 16." href="#ftn18"><sup>16</sup></a></span> Pudgar reflected on the visit by Yugoslavia’s Federal Secretary of Defence to Ethiopia during which an agreement on military cooperation between the two countries was signed. Although the line between presenting the concerns voiced by (unnamed) Western and African press and the correspondent’s own concerns is in places blurred, the overall condemnatory tone of the commentary is undeniable. Amidst a great humanitarian crisis, threatening the lives of 5 million people, Yugoslavia had been selling guns to the hunger-stricken undemocratic regime rather than saving civilian lives by donating humanitarian aid. The visit is explicitly labelled as grotesque, noting that even the biggest exporters of arms to Ethiopia were currently focusing on delivering humanitarian aid to the country. In the commentary, two complementary frames appear alongside the central frame of the immorality of prioritising arms trade over humanitarian relief. The first concerns Yugoslavia’s foreign policy of Non-Alignment, namely, its stated advocacy of peace and the peaceful resolution of conflicts, and its principled support for liberation movements. Not only is the Yugoslav position questioned (the policy of peacefully resolving conflict and becoming one of the leading arms exporters to developing countries), but Pudgar also raises the question of the “just recipient” of Yugoslav support by labelling the Eritrean side as “resistance” movement fighting for independence from Ethiopia. The second complementary frame concerns the YPA’s role in dictating political and economic life in Yugoslavia given the substantial contribution made by the arms trade (then estimated at USD 2 billion) to the struggling national economy.</p><p id="index-p-d46e381"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>The publishing of this commentary caused a commotion in circles of the military and the federal government. Two days later, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Delo</span> published an article of comparable length on the same part of the last page – a standard feature of a correction but not labelled as such – which listed various forms of Yugoslav economic and educational collaboration with Ethiopia. Pressure began to mount on <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Delo</span> and Pudgar. The Belgrade-based daily <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Borba</span>, the official newspaper of the Yugoslav League of Communists, published a rebuttal written by the Yugoslav federal Secretary for Information Svetozar Duritović which also demanded that <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Delo</span> correct its “serious errors of editorial judgement”. Pudgar was called in for an interview at the Yugoslav embassy in Nairobi.<span id="ftn19_return"><a class="notelink" title="According to Mamula, Pudgar claimed during the ‘interview’ at the Yugoslav that his commentary had been heavily edited by Delo to give it a more conde…" href="#ftn19"><sup>17</sup></a></span> Duritović’s rebuttal introduced three oppositional frames which were to dominate the federalist perspective in the following months: unfounded attacks on the YPA, Yugoslav foreign policy’s consistent commitment to emancipatory struggles and the principles of Non-Alignment, and the dangerous propositions of Slovenia’s reform aspirations, complemented by an emphasis on Yugoslavia’s continuous developmental support for Ethiopia. <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Delo</span> reprinted the <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Borba</span> article on 10 February together with an editorial response by Danilo Slivnik who dismissed Duritović’s accusations and argued for <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Delo’s</span> editorial independence.

The dominant frame was the immorality of arms sales amid a humanitarian disaster. Yet, Suhadolnik’s editorial was written as a much more direct and personal attack on the Federal Secretary of Defence. Mamula was not only a personification of the army, the charge of immorality by the YPA was transferred to him personally as he is openly labelled a morally objectionable individual. The dominant frame rendering the YPA “worthy only of contempt” is complemented by the frame of the two-faced foreign policy (the hypocrisy of selling “guns with flowers of Non-Alignment in their barrels” and advocating the policy of non-interference while knowing that the guns would be used to fight civil wars and guerrillas). Like <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Delo’s</span> commentary, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina’s</span> Friday editorial was swiftly denounced by <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Borba</span> on Monday (15 February), making similar accusations.</p><p id="index-p-d46e470"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>The tensions escalated throughout February and March. Aided by federal institutions and the Serbian media, the YPA launched a two-pronged attack on Slovenian media and the Slovenian political elite, leaving the League of Communists of Slovenia to weigh up its reformist agenda against the mounting threat of a declaration of a state of emergency in Slovenia. The YPA concluded that it had been the victim of a “special warfare” attack instigated by the Yugoslav immigration and foreign secret services with the intention of breaking up Yugoslavia. According to the YPA, as the principal exponents of this attack the Slovenian media needed to “fall back in line”, as did the Slovenian political elite.<span id="ftn23_return"><a class="notelink" title="A more detailed description of this multi-layered confrontation cannot be given due to space limitations.

He reports on Mengistu Haile Mariam’s plans to build up Ethiopia’s military industry as “completely unrealistic” and “beyond the boundaries of reason”. The feasibility study the Yugoslavia side committed itself to preparing in the controversial agreement is seen as a way for “grounding” Mengistu’s plans and postponing the decision to enter into extensive military collaboration. Extreme caution is advised given the political sensitivity of the matter and Ethiopia’s inability to finance the venture. Interestingly, a day before Pudgar’s commentary was published in <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Delo</span>, Mamula raised concerns regarding – in his opinion – the exaggerated publicity that the Ethiopian side had given to the event, noting that the event’s visibility while withholding information about details of the agreement had led to speculation “in other countries about what we want and what we are doing.

In the process, it harvested the framing potential of the visuals – namely photographs, but also illustrations. The 19 February edition thus carried both a commentary responding to Belgrade’s criticism and a full-page mock advertisement – a photo of a visibly starved African begging for food, captioned with a quote attributed to Hermann Göring (“Guns will give us power, we will only get fat from butter”) and a phrase used as justification for the Yugoslav arms sales (“If we will not do it, someone else will”). In the next five issues, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina</span> published a special section entitled <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Afrika, moje dežela</span>,<span id="ftn29_return"><a class="notelink" title="The slogan referenced Slovenia’s popular tourism promotion slogan Slovenija moja dežela." href="#ftn29"><sup>27</sup></a></span> featuring a total of 14 articles. The frames advanced in the <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Afrika, moja dežela</span> section were the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia, the immorality of the Yugoslav arms sales (labelled e.g. as “a contribution to the global image of hell”), especially to regimes with a dubious democratic record. The frame questioning the extensive contribution of arms sales to the Yugoslav economy also appeared, supporting the claim for the need for public control of the YPA. Unattributed images of starved Ethiopian children, familiar from the 1984–1985 Ethiopian famine, prominently accompanied several articles. While photographs promoted the humanitarian crisis frame, editorial illustration was used to support the immorality of the arms trade to undemocratic “friendly” regimes (e.g. the magazine cover from 8 April 1988). Parallel to this, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina</span> also exposed how Admiral Mamula’s seaside villa was being built using conscripts as unpaid labour,<span id="ftn30_return"><a class="notelink" title="The expose ran over four issues between 4 and 23 March 1988." href="#ftn30"><sup>28</sup></a></span> reinforcing the frame of the YPA’s immorality. <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina’s</span> reporting is hence a combination of topical (YPA and arms trade) and event-specific frames (Ethiopia). In April, event-specific frames gain greater prominence as <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina</span> publishes a letter from Eritrean exchange students from Ljubljana,<span id="ftn31_return"><a class="notelink" title="“Eritreja bee free!!!!,” Mladina, 8 April 1988, 14." href="#ftn31"><sup>29</sup></a></span> followed by a short photo-interview under the title <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Eritreja must be free!</span><span id="ftn32_return"><a class="notelink" title="“Eritreja must be free!,” Mladina, 15 April 1988, 6." href="#ftn32"><sup>30</sup></a></span> With this, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina’s</span> emphasis moves from analysing the situation in Ethiopia to advancing the arguments for the justness of the Eritrean struggle for independence from the centralist and undemocratic Ethiopian regime. Within this frame, the parallels between Eritrea and Slovenia are unmistakably present and Eritrea (rather than Ethiopia) is promoted as the side which should be on the receiving end of Yugoslavia’s policy of supporting decolonisation and resistance movements.</p></section><section class="teidiv0" id="index-body.1_div.4"><header><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head">70 Films and 20 Interviews – (Re)Framing the Distant Other in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold" itemprop="hi">Eritreja</span></span></h2></header><p id="index-p-d46e587"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>It is within these pre-existing boundaries of controversy that in late July <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina</span> published a one-page announcement of forthcoming photoreportage.

Due to control over the flows and content of information imposed by official institutions, “our mass media” fail to accurately report the events.

Even if the narrative is factual and the photographs visually vouch for the text, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Eritreja</span> does not subscribe to the objectivity ideal promoted by the American paradigm of journalism. The journalists are clear about the fact they have picked a side, not in advance, but based on what they saw and heard in the field. “It became a rather rapturous report on the liberation movement /.../ We were captured by the enthusiasm of people, this is how I imagined the spirit in Yugoslavia in 1945 or ’46, the thrill of building their own vision of socialism, equality...”.<span id="ftn43_return"><a class="notelink" title="Gorazd Suhadolnik, interview." href="#ftn43"><sup>41</sup></a></span></p><p id="index-p-d46e698"><span class="numberParagraph">7</span>This makes it easy to see why <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina’s</span> reporting was labelled by the Ethiopian side as enemy propaganda.<span id="ftn44_return"><a class="notelink" title="During the publication of Eritreja, Mladina, also published a lengthy interview with the consul of the Ethiopian embassy in Belgrade (“Mi jih imenujem…" href="#ftn44"><sup>42</sup></a></span> <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina’s</span> journalists were well aware of their limited access to information (e.g. they did not visit larger cities), but they assign this largely to their lack of financial resources and language barriers rather than to EPLF propaganda.

The narrative, reminiscent of the Yugoslav national liberation’s struggle during the Second World War, would be immediately recognisable to <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina’s</span> readers: guerrilla warfare, active participation of female resistance fighters, networks of secret hospitals, sub-terrain factories, lively educational and cultural activities in liberated territories, introduction of gender and social equality, humane treatment of POWs, protection of war orphans, the enemy’s brutal and indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population. Even the derogatory label used for the Eritrean resistance fighters by Ethiopians echoed the all too familiar “Banditen” used by the Nazis to refer to the Yugoslav Partisans.</p><p id="index-p-d46e745"><span class="numberParagraph">9</span><span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Eritreja</span> does not advance the humanitarian or white saviour frame typical of Western media news from Ethiopia (and other developing countries) at the time, which was also strongly present in some of <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Delo’s</span> reports. <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Eritreja</span> proposes that Eritreans are not in need of our humanitarian help but our political recognition.<span id="ftn46_return"><a class="notelink" title="Unlike in Ethiopia, where starvation was threatening an estimated 5 million people, there was no hunger in Eritreja in the summer of 1988 according to…" href="#ftn46"><sup>44</sup></a></span> They are not presented as passive victims but as members of a functioning, self-organised community. They are neither helpless nor the threatening African Other, they are in fact very much like us. If anything, Eritreans resemble a better version of our socialist selves, or at a minimum a version of our better former socialist selves. Eritreans as a distant other are given agency on the levels of both words and images. On the level of text, this is most prominently achieved via interviews. In six chapters, the journalistic eyewitness accounts and factual information are extensively complemented with fragments of interviews with civilians and EPLF representatives while four chapters are in fact transcripts of interviews (with high-ranking EPLF representatives, a female rights activist, an Eritrean refugee, and Ethiopian POWs), accompanied only by Suhadolnik’s brief introductions and concluding commentaries. The chapters are not without the author’s presence, the typical genre characteristics of a (photo)reportage, but descriptions of newswork, logistic practicalities and personal impressions are neither the story in itself nor the driving force of the narrative. Similarly, the presence of the author<span id="ftn47_return"><a class="notelink" title="Unlike several of the previously published Slovenian international political photoreportages (e.g. Uroš Lipušček and Joco Žnidaršič, “Edini prijatelj …" href="#ftn47"><sup>45</sup></a></span> is not asserted via the genre’s openness to more expressive uses of language and its flirtation with literary forms of expression.<span id="ftn48_return"><a class="notelink" title="Smilja Amon, Ustroj reportaže v luči raziskovanj teorije novinarstva in literarne teorije (University of Ljubljana, MA thesis, 1974)." href="#ftn48"><sup>46</sup></a></span> Jože Suhadolnik’s photographs also depart from the typical conventions of the genre, such as the stylistic and topical ones criticised for example by Lutz and Collins,<span id="ftn49_return"><a class="notelink" title="Catherine Lutz and Jane Collins, Reading National Geographic (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993)." href="#ftn49"><sup>47</sup></a></span> or those linked to the more macro level critique of exploitative humanitarian voyeurism advanced by Sontag<span id="ftn50_return"><a class="notelink" title="Susan Sontag, On photography (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1977)." href="#ftn50"><sup>48</sup></a></span> and numerous others. In <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Eritreja, </span>Eritreans as the distant other are principally portrayed as subjects rather than objects.

Neither are they reduced to a backdrop: in the majority of photographs (34 out of 45), they are depicted through individualised portraits or appear in small groups of three to four people in which their faces are still identifiable.</p><p id="index-p-d46e798"><span class="numberParagraph">10</span>Although <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Eritreja</span> is not without images typically associated with modes of othering, these are consistently offset by images which give agency to the distant Other. Chapter 9 on female emancipation and the struggle against female genital mutilation for example opens with a full-page mosaic of portraits of Eritrean women, three of which are reminiscent of the “ethnic type” approach (the origins of which can be traced to racist biological and physical anthropology<span id="ftn52_return"><a class="notelink" title="Elanor Hight and Gary Sampson, “Introduction: Photography, “race” and post-colonial theory,” in: Colonialist photography: Imag(in)ing race and place, …" href="#ftn52"><sup>50</sup></a></span>), yet they are offset by subsequent photographs depicting a female welder, the portrait of the interviewed female EPLF activist, and two images depicting the entry to her underground office, and her work desk. In a similar vein, although the chapter on orphans in a refugee camp features images of smiling and playful children, it opens with an atypical full-page photograph of an Eritrean orphan holding Lego blocks. The smiles of the orphaned children are not appeals for humanitarian aid but testimonies to their decent living conditions.</p><p id="index-p-d46e810"><span class="numberParagraph">11</span>The photographic renunciation of Othering is also achieved via several visually inconspicuous, even boring photographs depicting interviewees and interview settings, which are reminiscent of the uneventful domestic political news photographs prevalent at the time. This visual domesticity was further promoted by the images’ almost complete subservience to the text. Rather than allowing for autonomous storytelling, there are several instances in <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Eritreja</span> where photographs are crudely and directly made to support the written text. The contrast between sophisticated and more prosaic images is indeed quite blunt.

S svojimi desetimi poglavji in skupno 45 objavljenimi fotografijami velja »Eritreja« za najobsežnejšo fotoreportažo, ki je bila kdaj objavljena v slovenskem tisku. Fotoreportaža je nastala v kontekstu <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladininega</span> boja za svobodo javnega izražanja in kritike državnih institucij, v prvi vrsti Jugoslovanske ljudske armade. Ta je februarja 1988 prerasla v odkrito konfrontacijo s tedanjim vodstvom Jugoslovanske ljudske armade z objavo uvodnika »Mamula go home«, v katerem je <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladina</span> kritizirala obisk Zveznega sekretarja za ljudsko obrambo SFRJ Branka Mamule v Etiopiji kot nemoralen (trgovanje z orožjem med veliko humanitarno krizo), jugoslovansko zunanjo politiko pa kot dvolično in nedosledno. Konfrontacija je postopoma prerasla v širšo kritiko Jugoslovanske ljudske armade, jugoslovanske zunanje politike in jugoslovanskega centralizma ter poleti 1988 kulminirala v »procesu proti četverici«.</p><p id="index-p-d46e1160"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Motiv za nastanek fotoreportaže »Eritreja« je bil »preveriti situacijo na terenu«, preiskati sledi jugoslovanskega trgovanja z orožjem z Etiopijo in prikazati, kako je uporabljeno v boju proti eritrejskemu ljudskemu osvobodilnemu gibanju. A rezultat tritedenskega raziskovanja »na terenu« ni pripeljal do obsodbe »trgovanja s smrtjo«; namesto jugoslovanskega orožja sta <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladinina</span> reporterja Gorazd in Jože Suhadolnik »odkrila Eritrejo«, ki jo <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladininim</span> bralkam in bralcem skozi fotoreportažo prikažeta kot družbeno in politčno progresivno nastajajočo državno tvorbo.</p><p id="index-p-d46e1168"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>»Eritreja« je z vidika študij (zgodovine) novinarstva na Slovenskem pomembna na dveh ravneh. Z vidika razvoja fotoreportaže kot vrste novinarskega sporočanja zaznamuje prehod iz »pobudniške« v »poročevalsko« fotoreportažo, v kateri novinar in fotoreporter ne nastopata več v vlogi družbenopolitičnih delavcev, temveč kot neodvisna poročevalca – očividca, ki temo »na terenu« preiskujeta v imenu obveščenosti javnosti. Ob tem predstavlja »Eritreja« eno zgodnjih aplikacij te vrste novinarskega poročanja za pokrivanje pomembnih mednarodnopolitičnih dogodkov in žarišč. Hkrati je pomembna tudi z vidika reprezentacije oddaljenega drugega. Je namreč primer fotoreportaže, ki odstopa tako od dominantnega etnocentričnega in (neo)kolonialnega pogleda, v katerem je oddaljeni drugi reduciran na podobe tujosti in eksotičnosti (Drugosti), kot tudi od takrat uveljavljenega vizualnega narativa o Etiopiji, zamejenega na podobe lakote in vojne.</p><p id="index-p-d46e1169"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Analiza besednih in slikovnih strategij za konstrukcijo drugosti pokaže, da se »Eritreja« konstrukciji Drugosti na besedilni ravni izogiba predvsem skozi »dajanje glasu« eritrejski strani v obliki dolgih izjav in prepisov intervjujev ter odsotnost odkritega vrednotenja reporterjev. Na vizualni ravni so ekvivalent te strategije veliko število portretnih fotografij, ki ne podlegajo konvencijam upodabljanj eksotičnega Drugega, ter podobe, ki kažejo lokalno prebivalstvo kot aktivne člane družbe pri opravljanju raznolikih kompleksnih opravil, ne pa kot žrtve ali zgolj pasivne prejemnike pomoči. Vizualno in besedno je strategija preseganja Drugosti utemeljena na iskanju vzporednic med slovensko/jugoslovansko in eritrejsko družbo, ki slednjo predstavlja skozi <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladininemu</span> občinstvu domačne vsebinske in interpretativne okvire jugoslovanskega narodnoosvobodilnega boja in povojnih prizadevanj za izgradnjo naprednejše družbene ureditve. Multimodalna analiza okvirjanja novic, ki jo dopolnjuje metoda poglobljenih intervjujev z ustvarjalcema fotoreportaže, pokaže, da drugačnost »Eritreje« v veliki meri izhaja iz <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Mladinine</span> takratne uredniške politike in tematske vpetosti fotoreportaže v domače politične boje.</p></section></div><!--Notes in [TEI]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Notes</div><div class="note" id="ftn1"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn1_return"><sup>*</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">The article is part of the project J5-1793 <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">The role of communication inequalities in disintegration of a multinational society</span> (Vloga komunikacijskih neenakosti v dezintegraciji večnacionalne družbe), financed by Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS).</span></p></div><div class="note" id="ftn2"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn2_return"><sup>**</sup></a> <span class="noteBody"><span style="font-weight:bold" itemprop="hi">PhD, Associate Professor, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana, Kardeljeva ploščad 5, SI-1000 Ljubljana; ilija.tomanic@fdv.uni-lj.si</span></span></p></div><div class="note" id="ftn3"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn3_return"><sup>1.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">Ilija Tomanić Trivundža et al., “Photoreportage in the Slovenian Press.

Interestingly, Mamula’s position on Ethiopia and the EPLF appears to have been very similar to Mladina’s.
