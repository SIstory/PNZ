                        fotoreportaže »Eritreja«, ki je izhajala med avgustom in novembrom 1988 v
                        tedniku Mladina in velja za najobsežnejšo fotoreportažo, ki je bila kdajkoli
                        objavljena v slovenskem tisku. Za analizo besednih in slikovnih strategij za

                <p>Between 12 August and 4 November 1988, the political weekly magazine <hi
                        rend="italic">Mladina</hi> published multi-part photoreportage on the
                    political and living conditions in war-torn Eritrea. Produced by the brothers

                    from the ground” ran for ten consecutive issues of the magazine and is regarded
                    as the most extensive photoreportage ever published in Slovenian printed media.
                    The significance of <hi rend="italic">Eritreja</hi><note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn5" n="3">Throughout this text, <hi rend="italic">Eritreja</hi>

                        photoreportage while Eritrea (English spelling) is used to refer to the
                        territory.</note> photoreportage for the history of Slovenian
                    (photo)journalism lies not only in its unprecedented scope. First, at the time
                        <hi rend="italic">Eritreja</hi> was a relatively rare application of the
                    genre of photoreportage to report on politically significant international
                    topics, hotspots and events. It is not that these topics were not high on the
                    political or media agenda, but visual coverage of them was scarce, notably of
                    political events and life in the countries of Yugoslavia’s political allies in
                    the Non-Aligned Movement. Such coverage was typically reduced to sporadic
                    spot-news images and protocol photographs of country’s political elites or
                    diplomatic meetings. Due to their scarcity, the few photoreportages which were
                    produced, provide important material for studying the processes of imagi(ni)ng
                    geographically distant Others. Second, <hi rend="italic">Eritreja</hi> is
                    important for its context – it is inseparably connected with <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mladina’s</hi> struggle for greater freedom of public expression during the
                    second half of the 1980s by provocatively challenging taboo topics in socialist
                    Yugoslavia, such as ‘the life and work’ of Marshal Josip Broz Tito and
                    ‘accomplishments of the revolution’, namely, the self-management system, the
                    foreign policy doctrine of Non-Alignment, and the Yugoslav People’s Army
                    (YPA).</p>
                <p>In the late 1980s, tensions started to mount between the federal YPA and the both
                    reformist and increasingly nationalistic political elites in Yugoslavia’s
                    constituent republics. <hi rend="italic">Mladina</hi> often placed itself at the
                    forefront of these debates, championing topics like civil military service and
                    criticising the plans to increase military spending. The relationship between
                        <hi rend="italic">Mladina</hi> and the YPA escalated in February 1988 when
                        <hi rend="italic">Mladina</hi> openly criticised the Federal Secretary of
                    Defence Admiral Branko Mamula’s visit to Addis Ababa, calling him a "merchant of
                    death" for selling arms to famine-stricken Ethiopia. This turned into an open
                    confrontation between <hi rend="italic">Mladina</hi> and the YPA, lasting
                    throughout the spring of 1988 and culminating in the arrest of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mladina’s</hi> journalists and editors Janez Janša, David Tasić and Franci
                    Zavrl, along with YPA officer Ivan Borštner on charges of having revealed
                    military secrets. Their subsequent trial before the military court (popularly
                    known as the JBTZ trial), with which the YPA intended to tame Slovenia’s reform
                    aspirations, became a galvanising moment in the process of its succession from
                    Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>Given its position at the intersection of domestic and international narratives,
                        <hi rend="italic">Eritreja</hi> is both a unique and informative example for
                    studying the representation of distant Others. The article commences by
                    situating <hi rend="italic">Eritreja</hi> within a specific trajectory of the
                    development of photoreportage as a genre within the context of Slovenian
                    (photo)journalism. The main research question considered in the article – <hi
                        rend="italic">How is the Other represented in the Eritreja
                        photoreportage?</hi> – is addressed through a two-step multimodal framing
                    analysis. The first step focuses on reports appearing in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Delo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mladina</hi> in the spring of 1988 when
                    Yugoslavia’s arrangements for arms sales to Ethiopia amidst the burgeoning
                    humanitarian crisis had drawn journalistic criticism. In this step, the
                    competing dominant news frames are identified. Against this contextual
                    background, the second step in the analysis focuses exclusively on <hi
                        rend="italic">Eritreja</hi> and its representation of Otherness. In an
                    attempt to trace the factors influencing the content and look of the published
                    photoreportage, the multimodal framing analysis is complemented with
                    semi-structured interviews with the authors of the photoreportage.</p>

                        rend="italic">Eritreja</hi> falls in the category of watchdog
                    photoreportage, which was not solely driven by the desire to “record and show
                    the conditions on the ground”. During the late 1980s, watchdog photoreportage
                    was both a fact-finding and fact-checking operation in which photographs
                    supplied visual proof of verbal accounts. It was initially used in Slovenian
                    media as part of efforts to break out of the information silos of the Yugoslav
                    republican media<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="6">Yugoslavia’s media
                        landscape was a patchwork of republic-based media which, due to the relative
                        political autonomy of the republics and linguistic obstacles, focused on
                        their national/republic-based audiences. In 1986, 2 years before Eritreja’s
                        publication, printed news was conveyed to Yugoslav citizens by 27 daily
                        newspapers and over 1,400 weeklies and periodicals. Only a handful of them
                        sold more than 10% of their circulation outside of the republic in which
                        they were based. – Slavko Splichal, “Razvoj množičnega komuniciranja v

                    the tensions between Yugoslav republics grew, Slovenian media commenced
                    independent investigations of the situation on the ground, initially related to
                    the ‘Kosovo question’ and later to stories indicating the failures of
                    Yugoslavia’s self-managed economy.</p>
                <p>Slovenian media’s use of photoreportage for imaging distant Others is naturally
                    closely linked to Yugoslavia’s leading role in the Non-Aligned movement (NAM)
                    and the federation’s associated economic, military, educational and cultural
                    cooperation with developing countries. The media’s interest in using
                    photoreportage as a vehicle to narrate Yugoslavia’s increasingly global economic
                    and political engagement gradually developed in the 1970s and early 1980s,
                    albeit it was by no means a large-scale or systemically supported endeavour. The
                    main news outlets invested in acquiring exclusive information on international
                    affairs, developing their own proprietary networks of foreign
                        correspondents<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9" n="7">In 1988, <hi

                    the already extensive network of foreign correspondents of the Yugoslav press
                    agency Tanjug.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="8">In 1983, Tanjug had 30

                    images. Even after Tanjug became the coordinating institution of the pool of
                    press agencies from the Non-Aligned countries (NAPAP) and thus led the
                    movement’s struggle against the domination of information flows coming from
                    Western international news agencies, the resources were committed to independent
                    textual rather than visual news reporting.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn11"

                <p>Limited resources meant that much of the published photoreportages in Slovenian
                    dailies (mostly <hi rend="italic">Delo, </hi>but also <hi rend="italic">Dnevnik,
                        Večer</hi>) and weeklies (initially <hi rend="italic">Tovariš, </hi>later
                        <hi rend="italic">Teleks and 7D</hi>) were ‘marriages of convenience’
                    whereby journalists were given cameras to supply images for their own stories.
                    Another common type of the reportage was a ‘side job’ produced by professional
                    photojournalists covering official (diplomatic or sporting) events abroad.
                    Professionally produced ‘mission-specific’ photo-reportages were generally
                    limited to sporadic accounts of international conflicts relevant to
                    Slovenia/Yugoslavia (e.g. the Iraq–Iran conflict due to the presence of Yugoslav
                    construction workers in Iraq) or to liberation movements whose struggles
                    resembled or were inspired by the Yugoslav Second World War resistance (e.g.
                    Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, West Saharan Polisario Front). These
                    exclusive journalistic accounts typically succeeded in presenting the topic to
                    domestic audiences from a distinctly Slovenian/Yugoslav perspective, although
                    the extent to which they offered an immersive visual experience of the situation
                    in the field and a ‘home-grown’ representation of distant Others is debatable.
                    In part, this was a result of the limited frequency and space given to
                    photoreportage. Even more importantly, it may be attributed to the restricted
                    selection of topics (conflict and official politics) and their visual style.
                    Unlike the genre’s earlier post-war applications in the magazine <hi
                        rend="italic">Tovariš</hi>, the photoreportages in question did not follow a
                    clear formal template, such as the array of different types of shots and
                    motives, or used the more engaged, personal or even artistic approach typically
                    fostered in the genre.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="10">Stylistically,
                        they were closer to the ‘home-grown’ style of news photography. For more on

                    prominently featured a commentary by its Nairobi-stationed foreign correspondent
                    August Pudgar. In the 700-word-long text entitled <hi rend="italic">Admiral in
                        the midst of hunger</hi>,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="16">Avgust
                        Pudgar, “Admiral sredi lakote,” <hi rend="italic">Delo</hi> 4 February 1988,
                        16.</note> Pudgar reflected on the visit by Yugoslavia’s Federal Secretary
                    of Defence to Ethiopia during which an agreement on military cooperation between
                    the two countries was signed. Although the line between presenting the concerns
                    voiced by (unnamed) Western and African press and the correspondent’s own
                    concerns is in places blurred, the overall condemnatory tone of the commentary
                    is undeniable. Amidst a great humanitarian crisis, threatening the lives of 5
                    million people, Yugoslavia had been selling guns to the hunger-stricken
                    undemocratic regime rather than saving civilian lives by donating humanitarian
                    aid. The visit is explicitly labelled as grotesque, noting that even the biggest
                    exporters of arms to Ethiopia were currently focusing on delivering humanitarian
                    aid to the country. In the commentary, two complementary frames appear alongside
                    the central frame of the immorality of prioritising arms trade over humanitarian
                    relief. The first concerns Yugoslavia’s foreign policy of Non-Alignment, namely,
                    its stated advocacy of peace and the peaceful resolution of conflicts, and its
                    principled support for liberation movements. Not only is the Yugoslav position
                    questioned (the policy of peacefully resolving conflict and becoming one of the
                    leading arms exporters to developing countries), but Pudgar also raises the
                    question of the “just recipient” of Yugoslav support by labelling the Eritrean
                    side as “resistance” movement fighting for independence from Ethiopia. The
                    second complementary frame concerns the YPA’s role in dictating political and
                    economic life in Yugoslavia given the substantial contribution made by the arms
                    trade (then estimated at USD 2 billion) to the struggling national economy.</p>
                <p>The publishing of this commentary caused a commotion in circles of the military
                    and the federal government. Two days later, <hi rend="italic">Delo</hi>
                    published an article of comparable length on the same part of the last page – a
                    standard feature of a correction but not labelled as such – which listed various
                    forms of Yugoslav economic and educational collaboration with Ethiopia. Pressure
                    began to mount on <hi rend="italic">Delo</hi> and Pudgar. The Belgrade-based
                    daily <hi rend="italic">Borba</hi>, the official newspaper of the Yugoslav
                    League of Communists, published a rebuttal written by the Yugoslav federal
                    Secretary for Information Svetozar Duritović which also demanded that <hi
                        rend="italic">Delo</hi> correct its “serious errors of editorial judgement”.
                    Pudgar was called in for an interview at the Yugoslav embassy in Nairobi.<note
                        place="foot" xml:id="ftn19" n="17">According to Mamula, Pudgar claimed
                        during the ‘interview’ at the Yugoslav that his commentary had been heavily
                        edited by <hi rend="italic">Delo</hi> to give it a more condemnatory tone.

                    frames which were to dominate the federalist perspective in the following
                    months: unfounded attacks on the YPA, Yugoslav foreign policy’s consistent
                    commitment to emancipatory struggles and the principles of Non-Alignment, and
                    the dangerous propositions of Slovenia’s reform aspirations, complemented by an

                        presented quite a lengthy discussion on the need to reform the YPA. – Andrej

                        1.</note> Signed collectively as “editors”, it was penned by <hi
                        rend="italic">Mladina’s</hi> journalist Gorazd Suhadolnik who labelled the
                    head of the Yugoslav delegation Admiral Branko Mamula a “merchant of death”.
                    “The chief editor Zavrl showed me Pudgar’s article, asking if I would write an
                    editorial”, as Suhadolnik recalls the event: “Looking back, this no longer seems
                    to me as spontaneous as it did back then. He knew I would do it very
                        emotionally”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn22" n="20">Gorazd Suhadolnik,
                        interview.</note>
                    <hi rend="italic">Mladina’s</hi> editorial framed Mamula’s visit to Ethiopia in
                    a similar way to <hi rend="italic">Delo’s</hi> commentary. The dominant frame
                    was the immorality of arms sales amid a humanitarian disaster. Yet, Suhadolnik’s
                    editorial was written as a much more direct and personal attack on the Federal
                    Secretary of Defence. Mamula was not only a personification of the army, the
                    charge of immorality by the YPA was transferred to him personally as he is
                    openly labelled a morally objectionable individual. The dominant frame rendering
                    the YPA “worthy only of contempt” is complemented by the frame of the two-faced
                    foreign policy (the hypocrisy of selling “guns with flowers of Non-Alignment in
                    their barrels” and advocating the policy of non-interference while knowing that
                    the guns would be used to fight civil wars and guerrillas). Like <hi

                    Friday editorial was swiftly denounced by <hi rend="italic">Borba</hi> on Monday
                    (15 February), making similar accusations.</p>
                <p>The tensions escalated throughout February and March. Aided by federal
                    institutions and the Serbian media, the YPA launched a two-pronged attack on
                    Slovenian media and the Slovenian political elite, leaving the League of
                    Communists of Slovenia to weigh up its reformist agenda against the mounting
                    threat of a declaration of a state of emergency in Slovenia. The YPA concluded
                    that it had been the victim of a “special warfare” attack instigated by the
                    Yugoslav immigration and foreign secret services with the intention of breaking
                    up Yugoslavia. According to the YPA, as the principal exponents of this attack
                    the Slovenian media needed to “fall back in line”, as did the Slovenian
                    political elite.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn23" n="21">A more detailed
                        description of this multi-layered confrontation cannot be given due to space
                        limitations. It included heightened tensions between the YPA and (Slovenian)
                        political authorities, tensions between the Yugoslav federal and Slovenian
                        authorities (on both the level of federal government and the League of
                        Communists), frictions between federal and republic institutions (public
                        prosecutor’s office), difference in stances between the Slovenian League of
                        Communists and the League of Socialist Youth of Slovenia, as well as open
                        confrontation with Belgrade-based media. For a condensed description of

                    insisted that the military delegation’s visit to Ethiopia had been grossly
                    misrepresented by the Slovenian media. Minutes of the 185th meeting of the
                    Presidency of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia dated 3 February
                    1988, when Mamula was reporting on the delegation’s visit to Ethiopia, and the
                    written report submitted by the military cabinet of the Presidency seem to
                    support his claim.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn25" n="23">RS AJ, DT 42/1,
                        folder 282.</note> Apart from arranging the conditions for the use of an
                    already existing earmarked and only partly drawn down loan, Mamula appears to
                    have been quite a reluctant “merchant of death” in Addis Ababa. He reports on
                    Mengistu Haile Mariam’s plans to build up Ethiopia’s military industry as
                    “completely unrealistic” and “beyond the boundaries of reason”. The feasibility
                    study the Yugoslavia side committed itself to preparing in the controversial
                    agreement is seen as a way for “grounding” Mengistu’s plans and postponing the
                    decision to enter into extensive military collaboration. Extreme caution is
                    advised given the political sensitivity of the matter and Ethiopia’s inability
                    to finance the venture. Interestingly, a day before Pudgar’s commentary was
                    published in <hi rend="italic">Delo</hi>, Mamula raised concerns regarding – in
                    his opinion – the exaggerated publicity that the Ethiopian side had given to the
                    event, noting that the event’s visibility while withholding information about
                    details of the agreement had led to speculation “in other countries about what
                    we want and what we are doing. I think it provoked criticism in the Arab
                        countries”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn26" n="24">Ibidem, 490,

                    the conflict with Yugoslavia’s foreign policy or the YPA. Instead, the dominant
                    humanitarian frame was now complemented with the frame of Eritrea’s just
                    struggle for liberation, while the debate on Ethiopian arms trade and the YPA
                    moved from the news to the readers’ letters section of <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Unlike <hi rend="italic">Delo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Mladina</hi> decided to
                    escalate the conflict. In the process, it harvested the framing potential of the
                    visuals – namely photographs, but also illustrations. The 19 February edition
                    thus carried both a commentary responding to Belgrade’s criticism and a
                    full-page mock advertisement – a photo of a visibly starved African begging for
                    food, captioned with a quote attributed to Hermann Göring (“Guns will give us
                    power, we will only get fat from butter”) and a phrase used as justification for
                    the Yugoslav arms sales (“If we will not do it, someone else will”). In the next
                    five issues, <hi rend="italic">Mladina</hi> published a special section entitled

                    articles. The frames advanced in the <hi rend="italic">Afrika, moja dežela</hi>
                    section were the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia, the immorality of the Yugoslav
                    arms sales (labelled e.g. as “a contribution to the global image of hell”),
                    especially to regimes with a dubious democratic record. The frame questioning
                    the extensive contribution of arms sales to the Yugoslav economy also appeared,
                    supporting the claim for the need for public control of the YPA. Unattributed
                    images of starved Ethiopian children, familiar from the 1984–1985 Ethiopian
                    famine, prominently accompanied several articles. While photographs promoted the
                    humanitarian crisis frame, editorial illustration was used to support the
                    immorality of the arms trade to undemocratic “friendly” regimes (e.g. the
                    magazine cover from 8 April 1988). Parallel to this, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mladina</hi> also exposed how Admiral Mamula’s seaside villa was being

                    reporting is hence a combination of topical (YPA and arms trade) and

                    from analysing the situation in Ethiopia to advancing the arguments for the

                    undemocratic Ethiopian regime. Within this frame, the parallels between Eritrea
                    and Slovenia are unmistakably present and Eritrea (rather than Ethiopia) is
                    promoted as the side which should be on the receiving end of Yugoslavia’s policy
                    of supporting decolonisation and resistance movements.</p>

                    recent ground-breaking victory in the battle of Afabet. The descriptions of the

                        Soviet influence in the NAM countries. By 1988 however, the collaboration
                        was small-scale in nature due to Ethiopia’s reliance on the Soviet Union. –

                        collaboration between the two countries is seen in a report on the Yugoslav
                        delegation’s visit to Ethiopia submitted to the Presidency of the Socialist
                        Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The report notes that Ethiopia had used up
                        just 30 of the 200 USD million of previously earmarked Yugoslav loans and
                        outlines how the last USD 40 million tranche of those set aside loans would
                        be used to establish an ammunition production facility. RS AJ, DT 42/1,

                        collaboration, the visit by the Yugoslav military delegation met with
                        disapproval from the Soviets, then the largest supplier of arms to the
                        regime. See Mamula, <hi rend="italic">Slučaj Jugoslavija, </hi>122,

                    – that the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> story was not the intended exposé of “the
                    hypocrisy of Yugoslav foreign policy, which supports the Ethiopian
                    dictatorship”. They struggled to find traces of Yugoslav military aid on the
                    ground: “In places where fighting had occurred, we would for example look for
                    it, but for example on crates of ammunition the Cyrillic inscriptions were in
                    Russian, not in Serbian”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn38" n="36">Jože

                    incriminating. The “real story” of the “expedition” was the “discovery” of
                    Eritrea itself. “I saw no hungry children in Eritrea”, recalls Jože Suhadolnik:
                    “Since we travelled with the UN representative [due to the limited budget], we
                    were more exposed to the humanitarian perspective than to direct combat. We saw
                    the investment in the education of children, the effectiveness of the healthcare
                    system, [gender] equality /.../ and these were at the time truly big topics for

                            >Mladina</hi>, 2 September 1988, 1.</note> acknowledges the importance of
                    the “real story” and its unexpected relevance for Slovenia. What is at stake,
                    claims the author, is not the cover-up of the hypocrisy of the Yugoslav foreign
                    policy and the immorality of the YPA, but something bigger. “Like Christopher
                    Columbus”, the Suhadolnik brothers “have discovered for us a new country. A
                    different Eritrea, a country entirely different from what it should be like
                    according to our media”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn41" n="39">Ibid.</note>
                    Botteri argues that the false, stereotypical mental image of Eritrea is in fact
                    a result of communication inequalities. Due to control over the flows and
                    content of information imposed by official institutions, “our mass media” fail
                    to accurately report the events. The problem is larger than the resulting false
                    images in our heads. It is about missed opportunities to learn from others: “we
                    could learn from the Eritreans, that civil society, in the absence of an
                    independent state, needs to self-organise /.../”.<note place="foot"

                    the bulk of <hi rend="italic">Eritreja</hi> focuses on this ‘real story’:
                    Eritrea’s healthcare (chapter 3) and education systems (chapter 4) and its
                    connection to the economy and agriculture (chapter 8), the institutionalised
                    care of orphans (chapter 7), the treatment of Ethiopian prisoners of war

                <p><hi rend="italic">Eritreja’s</hi> narration is a mix of surprising finds and
                    semi-disguised admiration. Conveyed through factual accounts of Eritrean
                    institutions, at times consisting of unusually detailed descriptions of their
                    organisational structure and policies, the chapters are narrated through a
                    combination of eyewitness accounts and interviews. Even if the narrative is
                    factual and the photographs visually vouch for the text, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Eritreja</hi> does not subscribe to the objectivity ideal promoted by the
                    American paradigm of journalism. The journalists are clear about the fact they
                    have picked a side, not in advance, but based on what they saw and heard in the
                    field. “It became a rather rapturous report on the liberation movement /.../ We
                    were captured by the enthusiasm of people, this is how I imagined the spirit in
                    Yugoslavia in 1945 or ’46, the thrill of building their own vision of socialism,

                        present the arguments of the other side, but to draw parallels between the

                        counterrevolutionary activities), and to pair the policies of Addis Ababa
                        with those of ‘Belgrade’ (e.g. centralism, denial of the right to a
                        referendum on independence). Interestingly, Mamula’s position on Ethiopia
                        and the EPLF appears to have been very similar to Mladina’s. In his
                        classified briefing to the Yugoslav presidency, he explicitly disagreed with
                        Ethiopia’s official line, saying “We know what Eritrean and other movements
                        are”, compares Ethiopia’s forceful relocation of civilians from Eritrea and
                        Tigray with concentration camps and criticises the regime for straying away

                <p>On the pages of <hi rend="italic">Mladina</hi>, Eritrea’s struggle for

                    stronger and brutal enemy. The narrative, reminiscent of the Yugoslav national
                    liberation’s struggle during the Second World War, would be immediately
                    recognisable to <hi rend="italic">Mladina’s</hi> readers: guerrilla warfare,
                    active participation of female resistance fighters, networks of secret

                    treatment of POWs, protection of war orphans, the enemy’s brutal and
                    indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population. Even the derogatory label
                    used for the Eritrean resistance fighters by Ethiopians echoed the all too

                    in fact very much like us. If anything, Eritreans resemble a better version of

                    selves. Eritreans as a distant other are given agency on the levels of both
                    words and images. On the level of text, this is most prominently achieved via
                    interviews. In six chapters, the journalistic eyewitness accounts and factual
                    information are extensively complemented with fragments of interviews with
                    civilians and EPLF representatives while four chapters are in fact transcripts
                    of interviews (with high-ranking EPLF representatives, a female rights activist,
                    an Eritrean refugee, and Ethiopian POWs), accompanied only by Suhadolnik’s brief
                    introductions and concluding commentaries. The chapters are not without the

                    active members of society, performing a range of complex tasks (from the
                    production of pharmaceutical drugs to medical examinations and teaching).
                    Neither are they reduced to a backdrop: in the majority of photographs (34 out
                    of 45), they are depicted through individualised portraits or appear in small
                    groups of three to four people in which their faces are still identifiable.</p>
                <p>Although <hi rend="italic">Eritreja</hi> is not without images typically
                    associated with modes of othering, these are consistently offset by images which
                    give agency to the distant Other. Chapter 9 on female emancipation and the
                    struggle against female genital mutilation for example opens with a full-page
                    mosaic of portraits of Eritrean women, three of which are reminiscent of the
                    “ethnic type” approach (the origins of which can be traced to racist biological
                    and physical anthropology<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn52" n="50">Elanor Hight

                    female welder, the portrait of the interviewed female EPLF activist, and two
                    images depicting the entry to her underground office, and her work desk. In a
                    similar vein, although the chapter on orphans in a refugee camp features images
                    of smiling and playful children, it opens with an atypical full-page photograph
                    of an Eritrean orphan holding Lego blocks. The smiles of the orphaned children
                    are not appeals for humanitarian aid but testimonies to their decent living
                    conditions.</p>
                <p>The photographic renunciation of Othering is also achieved via several visually
                    inconspicuous, even boring photographs depicting interviewees and interview
                    settings, which are reminiscent of the uneventful domestic political news
                    photographs prevalent at the time. This visual domesticity was further promoted
                    by the images’ almost complete subservience to the text. Rather than allowing

                <head>Conclusion and Discussion</head>
                <p>As a news story, <hi rend="italic">Eritreja</hi> went against the prevailing news
                    narrative of the time that framed reports from Ethiopia as either stories of
                    armed struggle or famine. It was instead a story about the absence of the latter
                    and the transformative social impacts of the former, set against domestic policy
                    agendas (Yugoslav foreign policy, public control of the military, the
                    democratisation of Yugoslavia) and the magazine’s advancement of its editorial
                    policy (freedom of press, investigative reporting).</p>
                <p>From the perspective of the main research question, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Eritreja</hi> is a clear example of a news story where distant others are
                    not represented as Others. However, irrespective of the similarities revealed
                    (e.g. a self-organised ‘indigenous’ version of socialism, parallels with the
                    Partisan movement) and lack of negative treatment, they are not presented as one
                    of ‘us’. Eritrean otherness is not the (neo)colonial cultural or civilisational
                    Otherness. <hi rend="italic">Eritreja</hi> does not subject Eritrea to the
                    Eurocentric gaze in which ‘black Africans’ emerge as largely helpless victims of
                    poverty, violence and/or natural disasters in need of ‘our’ help, a narrative
                    which renders the role of capitalism and the history of (neo)colonialism
                    invisible. The all too familiar visual template of famine victims, ‘pot belly’
                    children and white aid workers, with which <hi rend="italic">Mladina</hi>
                    initially confronted the YPA, is completely missing from the photoreportage.
                    Images of everyday life in a country at war vastly outnumber the macabre
                    photographs of armed struggle.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn55" n="53">Of the
                        56, only 2 depict fallen (Ethiopian) soldiers.</note> The Otherness is
                    avoided in both text (e.g. the focus on self-organisation and giving voice via
                    interviews) and images (e.g. steering clear of travel photography tropes).
                    Although a developmental perspective and comparative framework are still present
                    in the photoreportage, their unpacking requires careful contextualisation within
                    the NAM framework. Just as Betts<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn56" n="54">Paul

                    cannot adequately be read by a straightforward application of the mainstream
                    post-colonial analytic apparatus that would reduce the images to the visual
                    trope of white coloniser, the narrative of the ‘backwardness’ of traditional
                    Eritrean society must be contextualised within the third-world claims for the
                    right to develop alternative, ‘indigenous’ models of development and
                    modernisation, and accompanying discourses of socialist revolution. Claims of
                    the backwardness of traditional Eritrean society – voiced by the interviewees
                    and not by <hi rend="italic">Mladina’s</hi> journalists – are inseparable from
                    the claims of revolutionary progress and the EPLF’s vision of social
                        reorganisation.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn57" n="55">The different views

                <p>Further contextualisation (which lies beyond the scope of this paper) would be
                    needed to situate <hi rend="italic">Eritreja</hi> in the trajectory of
                    journalistic representation of Ethiopia in Slovenian press from the early days
                    of the ‘special relationship’ between Haile Selassie and Josip Broz Tito through
                    to the fading days of the non-alignment struggle. Regardless of its special

                        Ethiopia was the first sub-Saharan country with which socialist Yugoslavia
                        established diplomatic relationships. It was also one of the first
                        recipients of Yugoslav military and developmental aid. See Lazic, “Arsenal
                        of the Global South.” Cf. Paul Betts, “Crveni vetar promene.”</note> and its
                    continuous presence in textual news reports, the ‘image’ of Ethiopia appears to
                    have been markedly absent from Slovenian and Yugoslav press, reduced to a visual
                    register of protocol photographs and Eurocentric imagery of (Western) press
                    agency spot news coverage.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn59" n="57">This is for

                <p>But even without this further analysis, <hi rend="italic">Eritreja</hi> shows
                    that the question of the representation of distant others cannot be reduced to
                    information dependency or the scarcity of resources alone. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mladina’s</hi> sudden discovery of the ‘real story’, of the ‘real image’ of
                    Eritrea not only raises questions about information dependency, but also to
                    failure of the spot news paradigm as such. In itself, it is an insufficient mode
                    of representing social reality and must be complemented by investigative
                    multimodal long-form journalism. Moreover, <hi rend="italic">Eritreja</hi>
                    demonstrates the extent to which the representation of distant Others depends on
                    the editorial policy of the news outlet involved, as well as the broader
                    political milieu<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn60" n="58">The ‘Afro-pessimism’
                        and its underlying structure of the West as subjects and aid givers and

                        which brushes aside the questions of (colonial) history and (neo-colonial)
                        economy, is an ideological and, by extension, a political project (see e.g.

                        Praeger, 1992)). The Western media coverage of Ethiopian famines during the
                        1980s was substantially influenced by the Cold War frame, presenting the
                        failings of a “communist country”. On recent variations, see Mel Bunce,

                    Eritrea and Ethiopia. By that time, the <hi rend="italic">Eritrean </hi>regime
                    was far from being a beacon of progressive social reform. No reference was made

                <p>One of the more lasting effects of <hi rend="italic">Eritreja</hi> on the
                    Slovenian mediascape is that it exposed the potential and benefits of
                    ‘indigenous’ photoreportage as a journalistic strategy for reporting on
                    important international events or hotspots. Throughout the 1990s and first
                    decade of the 2000s, <hi rend="italic">Mladina</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    domestic perspective. A number of photographers and photographer-journalist
                    tandems came to master the genre. Yet, this proliferation of the genre should
                    not be mistaken for systematic support for it among the media outlets. In the
                    vast majority of cases, the published stories were – like <hi rend="italic"

                        minimal. “I had to pay for the films myself, I developed them, I even

                    journalists’ and photojournalists’ convincing pitch of a story or the successful

                <head>»ERITREJA, MOJA DEŽELA«: FOTOREPORTAŽA IN POZITIVNA REPREZENTACIJA DALJNEGA
                    DRUGEGA</head>
                <head>POVZETEK</head>
                <p>Prispevek analizira reprezentacijo daljnega drugega na primeru fotoreportaže
                    »Eritreja«, ki je izhajala med avgustom in novembrom 1988 v tedniku <hi
                        rend="italic">Mladina</hi>. S svojimi desetimi poglavji in skupno 45
                    objavljenimi fotografijami velja »Eritreja« za najobsežnejšo fotoreportažo, ki
                    je bila kdaj objavljena v slovenskem tisku. Fotoreportaža je nastala v kontekstu
                        <hi rend="italic">Mladininega</hi> boja za svobodo javnega izražanja in
                    kritike državnih institucij, v prvi vrsti Jugoslovanske ljudske armade. Ta je
                    februarja 1988 prerasla v odkrito konfrontacijo s tedanjim vodstvom
                    Jugoslovanske ljudske armade z objavo uvodnika »Mamula go home«, v katerem je
                        <hi rend="italic">Mladina</hi> kritizirala obisk Zveznega sekretarja za
                    ljudsko obrambo SFRJ Branka Mamule v Etiopiji kot nemoralen (trgovanje z orožjem
                    med veliko humanitarno krizo), jugoslovansko zunanjo politiko pa kot dvolično in
                    nedosledno. Konfrontacija je postopoma prerasla v širšo kritiko Jugoslovanske
                    ljudske armade, jugoslovanske zunanje politike in jugoslovanskega centralizma
                    ter poleti 1988 kulminirala v »procesu proti četverici«.</p>
                <p>Motiv za nastanek fotoreportaže »Eritreja« je bil »preveriti situacijo na
                    terenu«, preiskati sledi jugoslovanskega trgovanja z orožjem z Etiopijo in
                    prikazati, kako je uporabljeno v boju proti eritrejskemu ljudskemu osvobodilnemu
                    gibanju. A rezultat tritedenskega raziskovanja »na terenu« ni pripeljal do
                    obsodbe »trgovanja s smrtjo«; namesto jugoslovanskega orožja sta <hi
                        rend="italic">Mladinina</hi> reporterja Gorazd in Jože Suhadolnik »odkrila
                    Eritrejo«, ki jo <hi rend="italic">Mladininim</hi> bralkam in bralcem skozi
                    fotoreportažo prikažeta kot družbeno in politčno progresivno nastajajočo državno
                    tvorbo.</p>
                <p>»Eritreja« je z vidika študij (zgodovine) novinarstva na Slovenskem pomembna na
                    dveh ravneh. Z vidika razvoja fotoreportaže kot vrste novinarskega sporočanja
                    zaznamuje prehod iz »pobudniške« v »poročevalsko« fotoreportažo, v kateri
                    novinar in fotoreporter ne nastopata več v vlogi družbenopolitičnih delavcev,
                    temveč kot neodvisna poročevalca – očividca, ki temo »na terenu« preiskujeta v
                    imenu obveščenosti javnosti. Ob tem predstavlja »Eritreja« eno zgodnjih
                    aplikacij te vrste novinarskega poročanja za pokrivanje pomembnih
                    mednarodnopolitičnih dogodkov in žarišč. Hkrati je pomembna tudi z vidika
                    reprezentacije oddaljenega drugega. Je namreč primer fotoreportaže, ki odstopa
                    tako od dominantnega etnocentričnega in (neo)kolonialnega pogleda, v katerem je
                    oddaljeni drugi reduciran na podobe tujosti in eksotičnosti (Drugosti), kot tudi
                    od takrat uveljavljenega vizualnega narativa o Etiopiji, zamejenega na podobe
                    lakote in vojne.</p>
                <p>Analiza besednih in slikovnih strategij za konstrukcijo drugosti pokaže, da se
                    »Eritreja« konstrukciji Drugosti na besedilni ravni izogiba predvsem skozi
                    »dajanje glasu« eritrejski strani v obliki dolgih izjav in prepisov intervjujev
                    ter odsotnost odkritega vrednotenja reporterjev. Na vizualni ravni so ekvivalent
                    te strategije veliko število portretnih fotografij, ki ne podlegajo konvencijam
                    upodabljanj eksotičnega Drugega, ter podobe, ki kažejo lokalno prebivalstvo kot
                    aktivne člane družbe pri opravljanju raznolikih kompleksnih opravil, ne pa kot
                    žrtve ali zgolj pasivne prejemnike pomoči. Vizualno in besedno je strategija
                    preseganja Drugosti utemeljena na iskanju vzporednic med slovensko/jugoslovansko
                    in eritrejsko družbo, ki slednjo predstavlja skozi <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mladininemu</hi> občinstvu domačne vsebinske in interpretativne okvire
                    jugoslovanskega narodnoosvobodilnega boja in povojnih prizadevanj za izgradnjo
                    naprednejše družbene ureditve. Multimodalna analiza okvirjanja novic, ki jo
                    dopolnjuje metoda poglobljenih intervjujev z ustvarjalcema fotoreportaže,
                    pokaže, da drugačnost »Eritreje« v veliki meri izhaja iz <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mladinine</hi> takratne uredniške politike in tematske vpetosti
                    fotoreportaže v domače politične boje.</p>
