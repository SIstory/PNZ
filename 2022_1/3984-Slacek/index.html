Avtor pojasnjuje nastanek združenja s tremi skupinami dejavnikov. Prvi so bili interesi in strategije jugoslovanskih političnih elit in novičarske agencije Tanjug. Medtem ko se je Tanjug zanimal za povečanje svojega globalnega dosega in položaja na svetovnem trgu novičarskih agencij, so ga zvezne politične elite videle kot pomembno orodje zunanje politike. Jugoslavija si je že v času pred četrtim vrhom neuvrščenih v Alžiru prizadevala za institucionalizacijo informacijskega sodelovanja, čeprav so bili objektivni pogoji ocenjeni kot minimalni. Drugi dejavnik so spremembe v mednarodnih odnosih, saj se je združenje tiskovnih agencij pojavilo v kontekstu institucionalizacije gibanja neuvrščenih v sedemdesetih letih prejšnjega stoletja in njegovih prizadevanj »zanašanja na lastne sile«, da bi države tako izboljšale svoj položaj v svetovnem gospodarstvu in pogajalsko moč v odnosu do razvitih držav. Združenje je zato Tanjugove dvostranske sporazume o izmenjavi novic rekontekstualiziralo v večstranski projekt gospodarskega sodelovanja znotraj gibanja neuvrščenih, katerega cilj sta bili krepitev medsebojnega razumevanja in osamosvojitev od globalnih (predvsem zahodnih) virov novic. Kot tretje pa je razvoj združenja oblikovala institucionalna zgodovina gibanja, saj je bilo združenje zasnovano in institucionalizirano po vzoru že obstoječih oblik gospodarskega sodelovanja. Za spoštovanje decentraliziranega duha gibanja je morala Jugoslavija prikriti svoj angažma pri vzpostavljanju združenja tiskovnih agencij in drugih oblik informacijskega sodelovanja ter jih predstaviti kot večstranske projekte s široko podporo znotraj gibanja neuvrščenih.</span></p><p id="index-p-d46e124"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span><span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Ključne besede: Jugoslavija, gibanje neuvrščenih, Tanjug, Združenje neuvrščenih novičarskih agencij</span></p></section><section lang="en" class="abstract" id="index-front.1_div.2"><header><h2 lang="en"><span class="head" itemprop="head">ABSTRACT</span></h2></header><p id="index-p-d46e129"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span><span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">The article focuses on the process that led to the Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool (NANAP) being established and the factors shaping its emergence. The author explains NANAP’s emergence by referring to three groups of factors. The first is the interests and strategies of Yugoslav political elites and of Yugoslavia’s Tanjug news agency. While Tanjug was interested in increasing its global reach and position in the global marketplace of news agencies, the federal political elites saw Tanjug as an important foreign policy tool. Yugoslavia was actively pushing to institutionalise informational cooperation within the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) already in the run-up to the 4</span><sup style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">th</sup><span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">  NAM summit in Algiers, even though the objective conditions were deemed minimal. The second factor is changes in international relations given that NANAP developed in the context of the institutionalisation of NAM in the 1970s and its efforts to build “self-reliance” so as to increase its position within the global economy and bargaining power vis-à-vis the developed countries. NANAP therefore recontextualised Tanjug’s bilateral news exchange agreements into a multilateral project of economic cooperation within NAM, aimed at strengthening mutual understanding and gaining independence from global (primarily Western) news sources. Finally, NANAP’s development was shaped by the movement’s institutional history as NANAP was conceived and institutionalised in the mould of pre-existing forms of economic cooperation. To respect the movement’s decentralised ethos, Yugoslavia had to downplay and disguise its significant level of involvement in establishing NANAP and other forms of informational cooperation and to present them as multilateral projects with broad support within NAM.</span></p><p id="index-p-d46e136"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span><span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Keywords: Yugoslavia, Non-aligned movement, Tanjug, Non-aligned news agencies pool</span></p></section></div><!--TEI body matter --><div class="tei_body"><section class="teidiv0" id="index-body.1_div.1"><header><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head">Introduction</span></h2></header><p id="index-p-d46e142"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool (NANAP) was initiated by the Tanjug news agency in January 1975. The pool was the most significant form of cooperation between Non-Aligned media and a key project for strengthening “self-reliance” of the Non-Aligned world. As the first form of informational cooperation between Non-Aligned countries, it impacted future forms of cooperation like those between Non-Aligned broadcasters (BONAC) as well as the institutionalisation of informational cooperation within the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). </p><p id="index-p-d46e143"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The pool served as a news exchange mechanism that allowed participating news agencies to contribute their news items and make use of news items supplied by other participating agencies. NANAP’s stated goal was to address the gap in communication capacities between the Non-Aligned and other third world countries on one hand and the rich countries of the global North on the other because this gap was believed to have led to the inadequate and distorted representation of Non-Aligned and other developing countries along with unbalanced global news flows.<span id="ftn3_return"><a class="notelink" title="Pero Ivačić, “The Flow of News: Tanjug, the Pool, and the National Agencies,” Journal of Communication, 28, No. 4 (1978): 157–62." href="#ftn3"><sup>1</sup></a></span> By establishing NANAP, Non-Aligned countries sought to create a system through which they could exchange information about each other without relying on the big global news agencies, which they viewed with suspicion as a legacy of the colonial past and a tool of imperialism.

The first is to reconstruct the process of NANAP’s establishment in 1975 and its institutionalisation within NAM in 1976. The second goal is to uncover the factors that shaped NANAP’s creation and early development. Jürgen Dinkel provides a useful analytical toolbox by identifying three groups of explanations for the formation of international institutions like NAM: the first being internalist interpretations, which focus on initiatives coming from within the individual nation states engaged in building an association; the second are externalist interpretations which seek explanations in the context of international relations; and third, approaches grounded in institutional history concentrate on the ways bureaucratic culture and path dependencies emerging from the history of association influence the development of international institutions.<span id="ftn12_return"><a class="notelink" title="Dinkel, Bewegung, 16–19." href="#ftn12"><sup>10</sup></a></span> These groups of explanations are not mutually exclusive but can be productively combined to offer a fuller explanation of an international association.</p><p id="index-p-d46e222"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>I focus on these three groups of factors to explain the emergence and initial institutionalisation of NANAP:</p><ul itemprop="list"><li class="item" itemprop="item" id="d46e224">internal factors: goals and strategies pursued by actors within Yugoslavia, primarily Tanjug and the federal political elite;</li><li class="item" itemprop="item" id="d46e225">external factors: changes in international relations in both the global economic and political context as well as within NAM; and</li><li class="item" itemprop="item" id="d46e226">institutional history: the ways NAM’s institutional history shaped the development of NANAP.</li></ul><br itemprop="lb" /><p id="index-p-d46e228"><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>My research is based on archival sources of the Archive of Yugoslavia in Belgrade (cabinet of the President of the Republic, relevant commissions of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Socialist League of Working People of Yugoslavia) and the Diplomatic Archive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia (containing materials of the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Affairs of the SFRY).

The first significant international factor was the easing of tensions between the USA and the USSR, which met with mixed feelings among third world countries. On one hand, détente was viewed with relief, as the conflict between the blocs had raised the prospect of nuclear annihilation and had drawn third world countries into the power struggle between East and West. On the other hand, it was feared that the third world would lose what little impact it had on global politics as the USA and the USSR began to settle important issues bilaterally. A further concern was that the most pressing issues for third world countries like the persistence of Portugal’s colonial domination, apartheid in South Africa, the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, and the presence of military bases in third world countries would continue to be ignored.<span id="ftn14_return"><a class="notelink" title="Dinkel, Bewegung, 151, 152." href="#ftn14"><sup>12</sup></a></span></p><p id="index-p-d46e244"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The second big international factor was the persisting and even growing differences in development between the global North and South.<span id="ftn15_return"><a class="notelink" title="Karl P.

In the 1960s, developing countries turned their focus to the United Nations, with their efforts leading to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) being established and the Group of 77 being formed in 1964,<span id="ftn16_return"><a class="notelink" title="Branislav Gosovic, UNCTAD - Conflict and Compromise (Leiden: A.

In addition to efforts within the UN system, NAM focused on practical steps aimed at increasing economic cooperation of Non-Aligned countries with a view to making those countries become less dependent on the rich countries of the global North.

Even guaranteeing reliable radio transmissions was a challenge, let alone creating the conditions for professional journalistic production able to compete with the global agencies.

The activities in this year reflect remarkably well the Yugoslav plans for further actions laid out in 1974. The symposium proposed by the Yugoslav Institute for Journalism and other organisations was held in Tunis in March, while in August India hosted a meeting of representatives of news agencies and of ministers of information in New Delhi, which adopted the NANAP statute and named its coordinating body.

If the symposium was the culmination of cooperation between Yugoslavia and Tunisia, in New Delhi India asserted its will against their wishes. While significant political decisions were taken at the meeting, it was also marked by political conflict and a battle for prestige. India seems to have increased its activity regarding NANAP more for political and prestigious reasons than a genuine interest in furthering the cooperation among news agencies. While Yugoslavia and Tunisia argued that the meeting was to be held at the level of representatives of news agencies and to focus on NANAP, India insisted that the meeting be held on a ministerial level and the agenda be broadened to include all aspects of informational cooperation. Yugoslavia accepted this since the belief was that “we judged that it is very important to India to host a ministerial meeting of NA [Non-Aligned], especially after similar Indian initiatives have failed (CB [Coordinating Bureau], the summit of Asian NA), and this due to both foreign-political and domestic-political reasons”.<span id="ftn105_return"><a class="notelink" title="RS DAMSPRS PA R 1976 F-180 Telegram from the cabinet of adviser and assistant to the Federal Secretary Živan Berisavljević to Yugoslav diplomatic and …" href="#ftn105"><sup>102</sup></a></span></p><p id="index-p-d46e858"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Because the New Delhi meeting had been elevated to a ministerial level, it was disrupted by political conflicts: “First the minister of Laos attacked ASEAN countries, calling them ‘an extended arm of NATO’. /…/ Then the Palestinians attacked the Syrians because of the invasion of Lebanon and accused them of hindering the liberation struggle of the nation of Palestine. /…/ The atmosphere became especially heated when the minister of Sudan accused Libya of attempting a coup and trying to murder Nimeiry. /…/ The Indians attempted to prevent these accusations, pleading with the representatives that the conference was not a place for such dialogue, yet without success.”<span id="ftn106_return"><a class="notelink" title="RS DAMSPRS PA R 1976 F-180, Telegram from the Yugoslav embassy in New Delhi, 12. 7. 1976, 438623, p. 1." href="#ftn106"><sup>103</sup></a></span></p><p id="index-p-d46e862"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>The events in New Delhi foreshadowed the way political divisions within NAM would hinder the operation of NANAP, for instance, the conflict between the Arab states and Egypt after Egypt had signed a peace treaty with Israel.

The second NANAP conference, planned to be held before the 6<sup itemprop="hi">th</sup> summit in Havana, was postponed in the hope the issue of Egypt’s membership would be settled there.

Tanjug had an interest in strengthening its ties with Non-Aligned news agencies. There is no indication that the cause was a political commitment to the idea of non-alignment, but it was framed through the need to bolster the agency’s position in the competitive global marketplace of news. News exchange agreements had already been established as the preferred way of establishing ties with foreign news agencies and were not specific to Tanjug. Especially for a relatively small – at least compared to the big global agencies – and financially limited news agency like Tanjug, this was a way of stretching its limited resources and supplementing its own network of correspondents. Tanjug’s interests coincided with the interests of the federal political elites as strengthening Tanjug’s position in the world market was seen as a way of influencing public opinion in Yugoslavia’s favour. Tanjug’s expansion to the Non-Aligned world was viewed positively and supported by the Yugoslav state, especially the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Affairs, as Tanjug’s information infrastructure was seen as helping to promote Yugoslavia’s viewpoints in the world as well as a mechanism for facilitating information exchange between state institutions.</p><p id="index-p-d46e943"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>The second are external factors, namely, changes in international relations on a global scale as well as within the Non-Aligned Movement. With the rising gap between rich and poor countries, disillusionment with the UN, slowing global economic growth and the breakdown of the Bretton-Woods system in 1971, NAM began to focus attention on North-South economic disparities and practical efforts for boosting “self-reliance”, that is, strengthening South-South cooperation to improve its position within the global economy and increase its bargaining power vis-à-vis the developed countries. These efforts came to encompass information as well, largely due to Yugoslav efforts.</p><p id="index-p-d46e944"><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>The third are factors rooted in institutional history. Even though NANAP was an extension of Tanjug’s bilateral relations with Non-Aligned agencies and its interest in expanding to developing countries, the pool was recontextualised within the drive to institutionalise “self-reliance” through economic cooperation and had to be adapted to the established forms of this cooperation. Pre-existing forms of economic cooperation thus provided a blueprint for the institutionalisation of NANAP and informational cooperation more generally. The prevailing institutional ethos of NAM, reflecting strong opposition to centralisation, shaped the formation of NANAP as a decentralised, multilateral project. Although Yugoslavia was clearly the leading force, it had to disguise and downplay the level of its involvement and was investing considerable effort to attract active cooperation from other NAM countries (particularly Tunisia and India) and presenting NANAP as a multilateral project with a broad basis of support from the outset, even though this was certainly not the case.</p><p id="index-p-d46e945"><span class="numberParagraph">7</span>While NANAP achieved impressive growth up until the end of the Cold War, furthered Tanjug’s goals of expanding its presence in the Non-Aligned world and boosted Yugoslavia’s prestige within NAM, there were also important limitations to NANAP’s development. Political divisions within NAM came to hinder the operation of NANAP, it became a battleground for prestige and influence within the movement and was very publicly tied to undemocratic practices of NAM leaders like Indira Gandhi. Curtailment of the freedom of the press by Non-Aligned governments supplied the Western media – most of which were already hostile to the very notion that imbalances in global information and communication flows needed to be addressed – with proof that NANAP was simply a ploy whereby autocrats wished to stifle freedom of expression.</p><p id="index-p-d46e946"><span class="numberParagraph">8</span>The factors shaping NANAP’s early development often contradicted each other, for example, the interest of Tanjug and the Yugoslav federal elites in increasing Tanjug’s presence in Western media was counteracted by the need to institutionalise NANAP as a multilateral project within NAM. From the beginning, we can see that the very benevolent rhetoric proposed by Yugoslavia for the Algiers summit had turned into a belligerent battle cry against cultural imperialism during the summit. While former colonies certainly had very good reasons to feel antagonistic towards the cultural domination imposed by their former colonial masters, this antagonistic stance flew in the face of Tanjug’s efforts to cooperate with Western media, and the goal of increasing positive portrayals of the Non-Aligned countries in the West. Similarly, Article 5 of the NANAP statute tasked the pool with: “strengthening the unity of the member countries of the Non-Aligned Movement and the decolonisation of information”.<span id="ftn120_return"><a class="notelink" title="Coordinating Committee, News Agencies Pool, 216." href="#ftn120"><sup>117</sup></a></span> Such an explicit political mandate was antithetical to the dominant normative conceptualisations of journalism in the West and likely strengthened suspicions that information from NANAP could not be relied on.</p><p id="index-p-d46e954"><span class="numberParagraph">9</span>Moreover, the institutionalisation within NAM compounded another pre-existing problem; namely, that many participating news agencies lacked autonomy from state institutions and reproduced government propaganda, by further politicising the pool’s operation. The conflict between the Arab states and Egypt caused the second NANAP conference to be postponed until after the 6th NAM summit in Havana, and continued to plague the conference since the summit failed to resolve the issue. Another problem was that NAM states could easily regard the inclusion of an item critical of them as an affront, and conflicts between members were certainly impossible to report without causing a diplomatic incident. The need to gain support within NAM and present NANAP as a multilateral project from the very start led Yugoslavia to support India’s bid to coordinate NANAP, even though Indian news agencies did not participate in NANAP.

The pooling of resources was meant to overcome this dependence by increasing South-South cooperation, yet, even after pooling their resources, the Non-Aligned countries remained collectively poor. While Yugoslavia offered assistance in the form of technical aid and journalist training, these efforts were woefully inadequate for addressing the underdevelopment of communication infrastructure and the lack of trained personnel, notably in the poorest Non-Aligned countries. This meant Non-Aligned countries remained reliant on outside aid that could only come from the rich countries of the global North and the international organisations largely financed by these rich countries. Hence – paradoxically – the achievement of “self-reliance” very much depended on the aid and support of the very powers the Non-Aligned countries were attempting to break free from.</p></section></div><!--TEI back matter --><div class="tei_back"><section class="bibliograpy" id="index-back.1_div.1"><header><h2><span class="head" itemprop="head">Sources and Literature</span></h2></header><div class="listhead">Archive sources</div><ul itemprop="list"><li class="item" itemprop="item" id="d46e1011">RS AJ – Archive of Yugoslavia:<ul itemprop="list"><li class="item" itemprop="item" id="d46e1014">837 KPR: Cabinet of the President of the Republic.</li><li class="item" itemprop="item" id="d46e1015">130 SIV: Federal Executive Council.</li><li class="item" itemprop="item" id="d46e1016">507 A.

Avtor pojasnjuje nastanek združenja s tremi skupinami dejavnikov: notranjimi (delovanje Tanjuga in jugoslovanskih političnih elit), zunanjimi (spremembami v mednarodnih odnosih) in tistimi, ki so zakoreninjeni v institucionalni zgodovini gibanja neuvrščenih.</p><p id="index-p-d46e1245"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Ker je bila Jugoslavija glavna gonilna sila združenja tiskovnih agencij neuvrščenih, so bili cilji in strategije jugoslovanskih akterjev, predvsem Tanjuga in zveznih političnih elit, ključnega pomena za razvoj združenja in širše za informacijsko sodelovanje znotraj gibanja neuvrščenih. Tanjug je želel krepiti sodelovanje z neuvrščenimi tiskovnimi agencijami in na tak način izboljšati svoj položaj na globalnem trgu tiskovnih agencij. Ta interes je sovpadal z interesi zveznih političnih elit, ki so s krepitvijo globalnega dosega Tanjuga želele povečati svoj vpliv na medijsko poročanje in javno mnenje v drugih državah, predvsem neuvrščenih in na Zahodu. Zvezne oblasti so podpirale Tanjugovo širitev v neuvrščeni svet, saj so si od tega obetale učinkovitejšo promocijo svojih stališč v svetu in boljši pretok informacij med državnimi institucijami.</p><p id="index-p-d46e1246"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Druga skupina dejavnikov so spremembe v mednarodnih odnosih. Z naraščajočo vrzeljo med bogatimi in revnimi državami, popuščanjem napetosti med ZDA in Sovjetsko zvezo, razočaranjem tretjega sveta nad Združenimi narodi, upočasnitvijo svetovne gospodarske rasti in zlomom bretton-woodskega sistema leta 1971 je gibanje neuvrščenih začelo usmerjati povečano pozornost na gospodarske razlike med severom in jugom ter na praktična prizadevanja za spodbujanje sodelovanja jug‒jug. Ta prizadevanja so predvsem zaradi jugoslovanskih pobud vključevala tudi informacijsko sodelovanje, najprej v obliki združenja tiskovnih agencij, po katerem so se zgledovale druge oblike sodelovanja med neuvrščenimi množičnimi mediji.</p><p id="index-p-d46e1247"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Tretja skupina so dejavniki, ki izhajajo iz institucionalne zgodovine gibanja. Čeprav je združenje tiskovnih agencij izhajalo iz Tanjugovih dvostranskih dogovorov z neuvrščenimi agencijami, je bilo rekontekstualizirano v okviru težnje po institucionalizaciji sodelovanja jug‒jug z in ga je bilo treba prilagoditi ustaljenim oblikam tega sodelovanja. Prevladujoči institucionalni etos NAM, ki </p><p id="index-p-d46e1248"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>je nasprotoval centralizaciji, je vplival na to, da se je združenje tiskovnih agencij razvijalo kot decentraliziran multilateralen projekt. Čeprav je bila Jugoslavija očitno vodilna sila, je morala prikrivatii stopnjo svojega angažmaja in je vlagala veliko truda, da bi pritegnila aktivno sodelovanje drugih neuvrščenih držav (zlasti Tunizije in Indije) ter predstavila združenje kot večstranski projekt s široko podporo že od samega začetka. </p><p id="index-p-d46e1249"><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>Kljub temu da je združenje tiskovnih agencij ob koncu hladne vojne pritegnilo k sodelovanju skorajda vse neuvrščene države, omogočalo Tanjugu okrepiti prisotnost v neuvrščenem svetu in Jugoslaviji, da je utrdila svoj prestiž znotraj gibanja, ter spodbujalo razvoj informacijske infrastrukture in oblikovanje tiskovnih agencij v neuvrščenih državah, pa so že kmalu po ustanovitvi postale očitne njegove omejitve. Delovanje združenja so hromile politične delitve znotraj gibanja neuvrščenih, postalo je bojišče za prestiž in vpliv znotraj gibanja in bilo zelo vidno povezano z nedemokratičnimi praksami določenih voditeljev neuvrščenih držav. Prav tako je delovanje združenja ves čas zaznamovalo pomanjkanje tehnične opreme, finančnih sredstev in usposobljenega osebja.</p></section></div><!--Notes in [TEI]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Notes</div><div class="note" id="ftn1"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn1_return"><sup>*</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">The article is based on research supported by the Slovenian Research Agency grants J5-1793 and P5-0051.</span></p></div><div class="note" id="ftn2"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn2_return"><sup>**</sup></a> <span class="noteBody"><span style="font-weight:bold" itemprop="hi">Research Associate, Social Communication Research Centre, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana, Kardeljeva ploščad 5, SI-1000 Ljubljana; <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="mailto:saso.brlek-slacek@fdv.uni-lj.si">saso.brlek-slacek@fdv.uni-lj.si</a></span></span></p></div><div class="note" id="ftn3"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn3_return"><sup>1.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">Pero Ivačić, “The Flow of News: Tanjug, the Pool, and the National Agencies,” <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Journal of Communication</span>, 28, No. 4 (1978): 157–62.</span></p></div><div class="note" id="ftn4"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn4_return"><sup>2.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">Branko Bogunović, “Informisanje o sebi i svetu,” <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Međunarodna politika</span>, Feb 1, 1976.
