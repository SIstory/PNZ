                <p><hi rend="italic">Članek preučuje "duh leta 1914" v Habsburški monarhiji – mit,
                        da je v prvem poletju velike vojne, ko so bili vojaki poslani v boj proti
                        srbskim in ruskim sovražnikom, celoten imperij prevevalo navdušenje.
                        Pojasniti skuša, koliko je bilo to razpoloženje spontano, koliko pa so ga z
                        vrha usmerjale državne oblasti. Ugotavlja, da sta ob mobilizaciji oba
                        navedena dejavnika vplivala drug na drugega. Prek izkušenj različnih
                        udeležencev si prizadeva prikazati dejansko raznolikost čustev v prvih
                        tednih bojev. Številni mladeniči so se priglasili v vojsko v pričakovanju
                        pustolovščin, veliko monarhističnih patriotov ali nacionalistov je videlo
                        vojno kot priložnost za "preporod" svojih ciljev, tisk pa je skoraj soglasno
                        trdil, da javnost podpira vojno. Vendar se je za to fasado upanja skrivalo
                        prav toliko prestrašenih ljudi, zlasti med starejšimi. Stroga cenzura
                        poročanja, uvedena na začetku vojne, je prikrivala te negativne odzive,
                        vendar jih lahko najdemo v dnevnikih in spominih iz tega obdobja. Iz njih je
                        tudi razvidno, da je bilo začetno navdušenje kratkotrajno. Številni vojaki
                        so hitro izkusili vojne grozote, zlasti na vzhodu, in travmatična doživetja
                        so jih popolnoma spremenila. Na domači fronti je šok sledil malo kasneje, ob
                        prihodu seznamov žrtev in beguncev. Do oktobra leta 1914 so prvotna
                        pričakovanja, izražena v začetnem "duhu", že začela bledeti. Država se je
                        morala soočiti z možnostjo totalne vojne, v kateri je bila njena sposobnost,
                        da zaščiti prebivalstvo, na usodni preizkušnji.</hi></p>

                        monarchy, the myth that an enthusiastic mood prevailed across the empire
                        during the first summer of the Great War when troops were sent off against
                        the Serbian and Russian enemies. It seeks to explain how far this mood was
                        spontaneous or directed from above by the state authorities, and finds that
                        both interacted with each other as mobilization occurred. It also seeks
                        through a range of voices to show the actual diversity of emotion in these
                        early weeks of hostilities. Many young men enlisted in order to pursue an
                        adventure, many imperial patriots or nationalists viewed the war as an
                        opportunity for some “rebirth” for their cause; the press was largely
                        unanimous in suggesting popular support for the war. However, underneath
                        this façade many individuals were as much fearful as hopeful, particularly
                        the older generation. The strict censorship of news from the start of the
                        war obscured these negative voices, but we find them in diaries and memoirs
                        of the time. These also suggest that the early excitement was short-lived.
                        Many soldiers quickly experienced the horror of war, especially in the east,
                        and felt changed utterly by the trauma. On the home front, the shock came
                        more slowly as casualty lists and refugees surfaced. By October 1914 the
                        initial expectations, encapsulated in the early “spirit”, were already
                        waning. The state had to face the prospect of total war, where its ability
                        to protect its population was fatally put to the test.</hi></p>

        <body>
            <p>One hundred years ago in October 1914, the “spirit of 1914” had probably already
                evaporated across much of Austria-Hungary. This was true among civilians in
                Ljubljana or in Prague, or even in Vienna and Budapest where there had perhaps been
                most enthusiasm for the war. But it was true too for many soldiers at the front,
                where the initial excitement about victory, the hope of glory and adventure, was
                quickly disappointed. The Habsburg armies did not quickly crush little Serbia; nor
                did they manage a quick victory over Russia in the east. Instead, the troops were
                retreating right back to Cracow in Galicia, while in the Balkans it was Serbia’s
                army that was penetrating into Bosnia-Herzegovina. This suggests to us immediately
                that the “spirit of 1914” – the enthusiasm that accompanied the outbreak of war –
                lasted only a few months. However, this time period measured in days and weeks was
                also relative because of what was experienced. Many civilians and soldiers felt in
                the summer of 1914 that they were living a whole lifetime of experiences. One
                officer wrote later that by late August he had drawn a line under his former life,
                for he was now entering a different world where events around him were constantly
                speeding up.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="1">Constantin Schneider, <hi
                        rend="italic">Die Kriegserinnerungen 1914-1919</hi>, ed. Oskar Dohle
                    (Vienna, Cologne,Weimar: Böhlau, 2003), 41, 45.</note> The war, which started
                with an energetic spirit, began in the space of two months to transform itself from
                life into death. Indeed, we might say that the spirit of 1914 disappeared as the
                phenomenon of mass death began to appear in towns and villages across the
                Monarchy.</p>
            <p>I want to analyse further this short period, this spirit of 1914. It helps us
                understand the different mindsets as the war started across Europe. It introduces us
                also to the various allegiances which existed in the late Habsburg monarchy: a
                complex mixture of imperial, national, regional and social. This contemporary
                spectrum of loyalties has often been hard for historians to resurrect or imagine,
                often obscured by the national mindset of later generations in a Central Europe of
                national states. Yet we need to imagine it if we are to comprehend how allegiance to
                the empire moved in a national-regional direction as the war progressed. The war
                also, while it slowly exacerbated nationalist tensions, was a time when many
                citizens first really encountered other nationalities from across the monarchy. This
                was either because refugees came into their home region (for example the 15,000 who
                reached Prague by early 1915), or because they themselves moved - as soldiers or as
                refugees. The four years of war therefore became an experiment in a true
                multinational (Habsburg) mission. It failed of course, but to understand that
                failure we must explore the hopes and expectations that were there at the start of
                the war. It was above all the military authorities who tried to push forward the
                multinational patriotic fusion and to minimize any national or regional differences.
                Because this led to major population movements, we cannot focus on one region or
                nationality in isolation when discussing the wartime empire. We must aim to range
                widely – beyond for example a local Slovenian experience – for that is how many
                individuals actually experienced the war. </p>
            <p>In studying the spirit of 1914 several questions immediately emerge. How did this
                spirit manifest itself? How can historians really measure it through the sources
                available? To what extent was it directed and managed by the authorities, or was it
                spontaneous from below? Finally, how long did it last? For the authorities,
                certainly, it was crucial to try to extend and maintain the population’s apparent
                commitment to the war. But how could that best be achieved, and how far did it
                require compulsion from above? Let us start by examining the spirit of 1914 in all
                its diversity.</p>
            <ab type="milestone" style="text-align:center">* * *</ab>
            <p>On 26 July 1914 in Celovec [Klagenfurt], there appeared a special edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Klagenfurter Zeitung</hi>, the main German newspaper. It announced
                triumphantly: “An enthusiasm for war has now broken out! The tension, which for
                weeks has been lying on us like an oppressive nightmare, has given way to a
                liberating sigh of relief”. The paper noted that on the streets of Celovec that
                afternoon there were many groups of people engaged in lively conversation, everyone
                interested and anxious about what would happen next. The next day at noon, a huge
                yellow hot-air balloon named “Steiermark” [Štajerska] was launched by the
                “Carinthian Committee for creating an Austrian Airforce”. It rose quickly in a
                north-westerly direction. When it was over the city, the small team on board threw
                out a mass of leaflets onto the population below. These bore a clear message:
                “Austria-Hungary! The army of our beloved fatherland is being partially mobilized:
                you should fulfil your patriotic duty enthusiastically! Long live our Emperor and
                    King!”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="2">“Teilweise Mobilisierung des
                    Heeres,” <hi rend="italic">Klagenfurter Zeitung</hi>, Sonder-Ausgabe, 26 July
                    1914. Also <hi rend="italic">Klagenfurter Zeitung</hi>, 28 July 1914,
                    1339.</note></p>
            <p>It is notoriously difficult to interpret this spirit of 1914 which suddenly seemed to
                dominate across the Habsburg lands. For as Manfried Rauchensteiner has noted, it had
                mass-psychological traits.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="3">Manfried
                    Rauchensteiner, <hi rend="italic">Der Erste Weltkrieg und das Ende der
                        Habsburgermonarchie 1914-1918</hi> (Vienna, Cologne, Weimar: Böhlau, 2013),
                    149.</note> What we can say is that, as in Germany (on which historians usually
                focus), a myth of universal war enthusiasm across Austria-Hungary quickly developed,
                and it was repeated in many political and military memoirs over the next few
                    decades.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="4">For Germany, see Jeffrey Verhey,
                        <hi rend="italic">The Spirit of 1914: Militarism, Myth and Mobilization in
                        Germany</hi> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2000). There is no
                    comparable analysis for Austria-Hungary, but see the useful discussion about
                    mobilization in Alexander Watson, <hi rend="italic">Ring of Steel: Germany and
                        Austria-Hungary at War, 1914-1918</hi> (London: Allen Lane, 2014), chapter
                    2.</note> Unlike Germany, however, the official Austro-Hungarian legend would be
                challenged after 1918 by a strong counter-myth in some of the Habsburg successor
                states. This questioned how far there was really popular support for the war in the
                summer of 1914. It proposed – in line with interwar nationalist narratives - that
                among some nationalities, there had been real reservation if not hostility towards
                the Habsburg war against Serbia and Russia. This was especially the case with the
                Czechs, but if we look hard we can find it among all other peoples of the Habsburg
                monarchy as well. There were always positive and negative national stereotypes
                circulating about “loyalty” but we as historians must seek to deconstruct them.</p>
            <p>Certainly in 1914 many individuals who were strongly loyal towards the empire were
                pleasantly surprised at the “spontaneous” patriotic displays – such as the dramatic
                “Steiermark” balloon - as well as the smooth process of military mobilization. Some
                were convinced that there was a public consensus for war. Thus, one German-Austrian
                officer recalled in his memoirs a ubiquitous “giddy enthusiasm” everywhere: all
                national hatred had disappeared and the only opposition came from “depressed
                    hypochondriacs”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="5">Schneider, <hi

            <p>But it was young men who seemed to be most excited about mobilizing their
                fellow-citizens. Many had been practising for such an adventure in the decade before
                1914. The last years of peace had seen an increase in youth groups across the empire
                – socialist, nationalist or religious. Most of these had an idealistic mission, and
                their adult mentors were encouraging them to mix healthy outdoor sports with a more
                serious goal of transforming an unhealthy society. For example, Austrian socialist
                leaders tried to keep a tight control on the minds of working-class youths. New
                Catholic or nationalist youth groups shared a common aim. They were fighting for
                either Catholic or nationalist “rebirth”, in order to resist the increasing dangers
                of modernity in the twentieth century.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="9">See

            <p>We can use one youth movement, the German Wandervogel in Bohemia, as a vivid example
                of this phenomenon. The Bohemian Wandervogel had been created in 1911; it sought (as
                in Germany where it originated) to reassert true, healthy German values in a society
                corrupted by a superficial bourgeois culture. But in Bohemia, in the context of
                Czech-German nationalist tensions, the hundreds of Wandervogel recruits were also
                told that their mission had a major national ingredient: it was about confronting
                the Czech enemy. As Karl Metzner, a leading Wandervogel teacher, announced in June
                1913, in Bohemia there was a high-ranking general who commanded all Wandervogel
                battalions: they could be mobilized when he ordered it.<note place="foot"

                surely emerge. Thus one youth leader noted in July 1914, “From this young generation
                a new nation will arise: for our descendants it will be better when this purifying

            <p>Many public figures in different parts of the empire shared this sense of
                opportunity, this chance to complete a special national or social mission. When
                general mobilization was announced, they spontaneously justified the final Habsburg
                “defensive” struggle against Russia and Serbia and placed themselves openly at the
                empire’s service, sounding a patriotic and inclusive note for others to follow. The
                Austro-Hungarian episcopacy, for example, made a united stand, even if it was
                nuanced to suit their various national congregations. Archbishop Csernoch of Hungary
                preached that the aims of the war were sacred and just. Bishop Anton Jeglič of
                Ljubljana preached that the struggle threaded together God, Austria and the
                Slovenian people in a common cause: the welfare of Slovenes was tightly linked to
                the church and the empire.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="13">József Galántai,

            <p>The literary world of Vienna and Budapest also declared its imperial patriotism

                Budapest it was not only traditional writers like Ferenc Herczeg who felt that
                national existence and civilization was at stake. Enthusiastic too were the radical

                revitalizing the Austrian mission. Although Hofmannsthal served only briefly at the
                front, he threw himself into public service at the War Ministry, organizing
                charitable support for soldiers and their families. This was all much to the disgust
                of the satirist Karl Kraus, who despised anyone who praised war from the comfort of
                their arm-chairs. But Hofmannsthal continued to proclaim Austria’s historic mission
                in patriotic writings and celebrated the monarchy in his wartime lecture tours.<note

                that an Austrian rebirth would occur, closely linked to some German renewal. Thus,
                one Austrian Catholic historian welcomed the war because, he said, it would give
                birth to a new “Greater Austria” which would satisfy all its peoples.<note

            <p>Yet for most of those living in the empire’s towns and cities, it was surely the
                choreography in their streets which had the greatest impact on the public mood. We
                can glimpse this from the way it was reported and presented in regional

                to some extent was the urban behaviour formally organized by the authorities. Much
                was “spontaneous”, even if much behaviour matched what individuals felt was expected
                of them when they heard their state was endangered. The cities of Prague, Zagreb and
                Celovec were typical. On 31 July 1914, Prague’s mayor, Karel Groš, publicly assured
                the governor of Bohemia that the city’s population was loyal towards Emperor Franz
                Joseph. A few weeks later, on the emperor’s 84<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                birthday, the city was decked in imperial and provincial flags; shop-windows
                displayed busts of the monarch as during his jubilee celebrations in 1908; and Groš
                after attending a mass in the Tyn church made another declaration of public
                    loyalty.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn19" n="18"><hi rend="italic">Čas</hi>, 31
                    July 1914, 2; 15 August 1914, 4. Groš in succeeding years regularly made such

                Zagreb it was the same phenomenon. On the monarch’s birthday the city was lit up.
                About 50,000 people took to the streets with lamps, so that the city was truly
                “swimming in a sea of light”. As one newspaper reported, the crowds shouted for
                their king and condemned the Serbs and murderers: “Enthusiasm for the old ruler was
                indescribable, but also for the war which he has declared on the enemy”.<note

            <p>In Celovec, meanwhile, the Landespräsident Alfred von Fries-Skene, had regularly
                appeared before the street crowds since July, responding to their public clamour. To
                stormy applause he told one large crowd: “Since the creation of the Habsburg Alpine
                state, our Carinthia has been a solid bulwark against every enemy. Her sons stand
                faithful and constant towards emperor and empire. Proud and firm like Carinthia’s
                mountains are the sons of her inhabitants, fearless and brave”. On 5 August, at a
                meeting of Celovec city council, the mayor recalled how the people clearly
                sympathized with the house of Habsburg in the face of Serbian-Russian provocation.
                He proposed a council resolution declaring that Celovec was totally loyal to the
                dynasty; the motion was carried unanimously.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn21" n="22"

            <p>As these press reports imply, the urban crowds in the first weeks of mobilization
                significantly contributed to the “spirit of 1914” across the monarchy. They suggest
                a public spontaneity from below which the authorities then tried to control and
                organize. The historian Jeffrey Verhey has noted this for Germany (but confines his
                sources mainly to press reports). The crowds across the Habsburg empire were often
                “active” (not just by-standers), and they performed certain rituals which followed a
                tradition seen on previous patriotic occasions.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn22"

                    Wilson Center Press, 2000).</note> The crowds’ character also changed steadily
                during the first six weeks of hostilities. Some were “curious”, some were “excited”;
                some “celebrating”, some “despairing”. We should be careful not to generalize from
                such behaviour, especially as reported in the regional press. But it is still one
                indicator of the diversity of mood at the start of the war, important because of its
                impact on both the authorities and the less active citizens who simply watched but
                were then motivated to respond. In Prague for example, the “curious crowd” was often
                to be seen as war was declared, with thousands gathering outside press offices on
                Wenceslas square; they moved between different newspaper offices, waiting for the
                latest special editions which were issued at key moments.<note place="foot"

            <p>In Celovec, a more traditional patriotic ritual took place among very loyal citizens.
                It was linked closely to preparations for military enlistment. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Klagenfurter Zeitung</hi> reported that the patriotic displays on the streets
                were fully inclusive - there were “thousands of people of every age and gender and
                of the most diverse nationalities” – but also spontaneous. We cannot quite say how
                far this was true. In fact, the crowds on 30 July seemed to take a special
                preordained route through the city, following a military parade that was celebrating
                mobilization. On this tour they stopped outside the house of the local military
                commander, then the house of Fries-Skene and his wife, before finishing on the
                square in front of a statue of Empress Maria Theresa. Here the three national
                anthems of the Triple Alliance were played; for it was expected that Italy would
                still be an ally rather than stay neutral.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn24" n="23"

            <p>Only occasionally did this façade of “street loyalty” slip, showing that not everyone
                was obedient. There were some “despairing” crowds – for example, those who despite
                government assurances in the press feared that the war would damage their savings. A
                cartoon in one Hungarian satirical magazine from early August 1914 could still
                portray an angry crowd trying to storm a bank, their faces anxious, their walking
                sticks raised in the air. The caption noted that the first siege of the war was not
                against enemy Belgrade, as one might expect: it was against the domestic banks to
                recover their deposits.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn25" n="24"><hi rend="italic"

                – the main medium for coordinating public news across the vast empire – the story

                dressed as St Nicholas and carrying a basket of fruit for these boys (Apponyi and

                concealed a range of opinions about the war across Hungarian society, not least
                among the Serb minority who in the summer had already shown treacherous sympathy

            <p>In the Austrian half of the empire, meanwhile, we find a different story, a more
                overtly negative dimension to the “spirit of 1914”. Here, where no parliament was
                sitting to proclaim political consensus, there was arguably more state imposition of
                that patriotic spirit, and in August it became steadily heavier. In late July, the
                Prime Minister, Count Karl Stürgkh, had ordered all crownlands to focus on the war
                mission and deal strictly with anyone who showed indifference or hostility.<note

                achieve this allowed the banning of demonstrations, arbitrary arrest without trial,
                and a strict censorship of the press to ensure an official presentation of war news.
                This management of the war mood was usually hidden from the public view, or at least
                rarely part of the public discourse. But we know it existed and, via press and
                postal censorship in particular, it soon began to affect everybody. Alongside the
                publicly uplifting spirit of 1914, there was also an underlying vigilant mentality
                which had been present in the previous years. The authorities now moved especially
                to arrest those Russophile and South Slav suspects who had been fingered and
                classified in recent months or years. In peacetime the state had usually behaved
                rather cautiously even against irredentists on the southern and eastern borders. But
                as part of the patriotic wave it was suddenly possible quietly to arrest these Serb
                and Ruthene “traitors” with no regard to civil liberties. A minority would be given
                public trials, some would be subject to summary court-martial (and executed), but
                the majority would be imprisoned indefinitely.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn32"

            <p>In noting this latent state vigilance – since most of this activity was not
                publicized to the rest of the empire - we can understand better the broad range of
                personal emotions concealed in this initial period of the war. Usually because of
                censorship they emerged later, in diaries and letters, or in memoirs which tended to
                distort the level of nationalist opposition to the Habsburg state. From these
                sources, immediately, we can detect some basic division in outlook between young and
                old in their response to the war. The old could be found warning young men who
                seemed too enthusiastic. As one new Vienna recruit, Wilhelm Möller, recalled: “My
                mother was a complete pessimist: she did not believe in our army nor in the fortunes
                of war: she prophesied a very unhappy time”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn33" n="32"

                Many of course suggested it would all be over in a fortnight, but some elders
                thought two years more likely; their voices were drowned out. At the railway
                stations in Tyrol the enthusiasm was always accompanied by an underlying
                seriousness. One farmer wrote in his diary: “The train was decorated with flowers,
                leaves and flags, but our thoughts were serious, death seemed to be not far away.
                The songs were sad, sad like birds on the snow”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn34"

                west across the monarchy and into Galicia, they were met at every station by women
                who cheered the soldiers with flowers, wine and cigarettes. But the men were always
                uncertain about their destination and how long they would be away from home. For
                Wilhelm Möller, the shock came at the end of August in eastern Hungary when he met
                his first train of wounded soldiers; he heard lurid tales about the retreat before
                Russian forces. “After our train departed, we felt a total change of mood in the
                carriage: everybody sat silently in his place and thought about [a victorious end of
                the war]”. In Galicia, Möller noted that, in contrast to Hungary, there was no
                celebration at the railway stations; instead they found a landscape of “miserable
                cottages, and a poor ragged people”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn35" n="34">Möller,

            <p>For most soldiers the real change in mood came after they entered the war zone. As
                one Hungarian officer - an artist in civilian life – noted, the banter and black
                humour of the men turned sour amidst the chaos. Time became concentrated on the
                present: “We think of nothing: nothing of the future, nothing of the past. Only of
                what is, now. What’s past is gone. The future could last five minutes. The only
                reality is the present”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn36" n="35">Béla

                first encounters with Russian forces. The boyhood boldness of many changed into fear
                as they entered the “danger zone”, and then horror and panic as they tried to
                survive in the front-line “death zone” where all rules were abandoned.<note

                had meant a quick escapade alongside other young men – became a struggle for
                existence as the Russian steamroller advanced. First there had been a sense of
                history at work, sweeping the men of the Habsburg army forward. Now it seemed to be
                working against them, forcing them into a personal struggle for survival. By
                September the army had already lost its early euphoria, with the old officer corps
                decimated on the Balkan and Eastern fronts. A new life began of the survivors
                struggling to make sense of defeat and death. When the wounded returned home, many
                felt alienated either by those who mouthed sympathy and curiosity, or by the false
                euphoria still present. One officer returning to Budapest after a few months
                recalled “the unadorned and harsh reality behind all the sympathy and the solemn
                extolling of heroism”. The reality at home, he felt, “was that everyone had become
                engaged in a determined, sullen fight for life. It was a fight waged in complete
                silence and secrecy, but was none the less fierce for all that”.<note place="foot"

            <p>When then did the euphoria end on the home front? In late August 1914, when the
                Landsturm soldiers departed for the front there were again celebrations in many
                towns and signs of optimism.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn39" n="38">See “Grosse

                        Zeitung</hi>, 29 August 1914, 5-6.</note> Yet already in September the lists
                of the dead and missing began to multiply in the newspapers. They were soon eighteen
                columns long in the <hi rend="italic">Klagenfurter Zeitung</hi>, while it was in
                November that such lists appeared in <hi rend="italic">Slovenec </hi>in Ljubljana.
                So the gap between expectation and reality began to widen at different speeds across
                the hinterland and no simple generalization is possible. Some people perhaps only
                became less enthusiastic and more detached when they learnt officially about the
                army’s failure to take Belgrade in December or, secretly, about the horrors of the
                Carpathian winter campaign. Some women, with husbands or sons at the front, would
                remain stoical: they had to stay committed in some way for the sake of their loved
                ones, often channelling their “patriotism” into humanitarian work. Some men at home
                were simply pleased to have escaped the draft either through illness or exemption.
                Others – like Franz Kafka in Prague – despite his abhorrence of official patriotism,
                remained keen to join up in order to escape boredom at home by participating fully
                in some kind of “war-immersion”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn40" n="39">For a
                    discussion of Kafka’s ambivalence see Mark Cornwall, “The First World War,” in

            <p>Other individuals had been publicly sceptical from the start. It was from September
                that this wider “disloyalty” or detachment became clearer to the authorities and
                they began to react. As the early enthusiasm died away, the military welcomed new
                patriotic displays but found different degrees of engagement from leaders in
                society. For example, German politicians from Bohemia-Moravia openly supported the
                war, but most Czech leaders were hesitant and ambivalent.<note place="foot"

                national leaders expected some reward, some imperial reform, as the price for
                supporting a new Habsburg war. However, there was not one simple stereotype of Czech
                scepticism as nationalist writers later pretended. In these early months – and also
                later – there were always some signs of Czech-Habsburg patriotism, a belief that a
                Czech future was bound up with Austrian fortunes too.<note place="foot"
                    xml:id="ftn43" n="42">Ibid., 18.</note> The problem was that the Habsburg
                military did indeed suspect Czechs of disloyalty, because of their leaders’ silence
                and because of signs of growing Czech insubordination at the front. In September for
                example, the politician Vaclav Klofáč, who was certainly an anti-Austrian “traitor”,
                was suddenly arrested without charge. It was perhaps a sign that the authorities
                felt the war to be entering a new phase and initial expectations required
                adjustment. Security had to be tightened on the home front, removing potential
                traitors, and strictly controlling the flow of information around the empire. It was
                the reality of “total war”. </p>

                The Habsburg regime had been preeminent in launching a war in late July and,
                initially, it found a lot of support for the patriotic crusade against Serbia and
                Russia. In this short first period, however, many expectations were floated which
                the state would never fulfil. Even if thousands of young men followed the call-up
                quite reluctantly, the best of their hopes was that it could be a short adventure
                with a quick victory. Instead, the soldiers became cogs in a huge military machine
                from which they could rarely escape except through injury, death or capture. All
                became, both physically and mentally, caught up in the momentum of a war which
                affected most parts of their lives. This included Conrad von Hötzendorf himself who
                was notoriously fatalistic. His confidence too was shattered early on when his son
                Herbert was killed, but he felt only victory could save the empire (and enable him
                to marry his beloved Gina).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn45" n="44">See Lawrence

                Others interpreted the sacrifice in a less traditional way. Often they were stunned
                and silenced by what they had seen at the front, but sometimes they sought a
                positive way forward, a creative “rebirth” for themselves out of the
                    destruction.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn46" n="45">See Zombory-Moldován, <hi

            <p>Civilians too, after the early euphoria, still expected benefits as the war
                continued. The “spirit of 1914” had exaggerated what could be achieved quickly. By
                1915 the mood was changing, and hidden aspirations from peacetime began to appear.
                These hopes – social or national – were often contradictory; some had been there at
                the start of the war, hidden under the show of Habsburg patriotism, and they would
                slowly begin to clash with the official Habsburg war mission. For the
                Austro-Hungarian regime, a major task after 1914 would be to prolong the early
                patriotism on the home front. Tied to the initial strategy of controlling and
                monitoring the popular mood, the authorities would turn to new pro-active methods of
                propaganda in order to justify the imperial crusade. These included annual campaigns
                in Austria and Hungary of subscription to war bonds; cultural exhibitions which
                engaged the public in a sanitized picture of the war; and war charities to aid
                widows, orphans and the wounded. The medium of film was a particular novelty, vastly
                expanded alongside the number of wartime cinemas (150 each in Vienna and Budapest by
                1915), in order to entertain and educate with a patriotic message.<note place="foot"

                    the empire.</note></p>
            <p>But in the end all depended on the empire winning and exiting the war with its
                territory intact. August 1914 had showed the authorities what patriotic unity could
                be like but, as we have seen, this was always a veneer which concealed many hopes
                and anxieties. The first public wave of optimism about a victorious Habsburg war
                disappeared with the summer of 1914. In its place came new expectations which
                matched the reality of mass death and sacrifice. The longer the war continued, the
                more pressure was placed upon the Habsburg authorities to deliver results in their
                role as protectors of the population. In this light the “spirit” which had been
                conjured up in August 1914 seemed quite ephemeral and also dangerous. For neither
                the regime nor the bulk of the population had thought seriously about how to manage
                life after the patriotic surge.</p>

                <head>POVZETEK</head>
                <docAuthor>Mark Cornwall</docAuthor>
                <p>Zgodovinarji so analizirali "duh leta 1914" – mit o navdušenju javnosti ob
                    izbruhu prve svetovne vojne – v več evropskih državah, udeleženih v tej vojni,
                    niso pa še opravili poglobljene analize za Avstro-Ogrsko. Namen tega članka je
                    nadgraditi dosedanje študije z nizom vprašanj o varljivem "duhu": kako ga
                    izmeriti, ali je bil spontan ali nadzorovan s strani države, kako dolgo je
                    trajal in kako bi lahko vplival na nadaljnji potek vojne. V tiskanih
                    zgodovinskih virih ne manjka dokazov o patriotskem navdušenju avgusta 1914.
                    Sodobnikom se je tak odnos pogosto zdel spontan in skladen s pozitivnimi
                    pričakovanji glede izida kratke vojne. Del tega je bilo tudi navdušenje, ki je
                    navdajalo številne mladeniče v pričakovanju kratkotrajne pustolovščine, pa tudi
                    patriote ali nacionaliste iz različnih delov monarhije, ki so upali, da bo vojna
                    omogočila nekakšen "preporod" in razrešila težave iz obdobja miru. Vendar je to
                    postavljaštvo večinoma sledilo tradicionalnemu vzorcu iz predhodnih patriotsko
                    obarvanih dogodkov in se je vsekakor pogosto prepletalo s pričakovanji oblasti
                    glede lojalnosti do države v kriznih časih. V tem smislu lahko razumemo
                    sporočila Katoliške cerkve ali številnih lokalnih oblasti, ki so javno
                    zaprisegle podporo novi "defenzivni" habsburški misiji. Tudi časopisje iz vseh
                    koncev monarhije je ubralo skoraj enoglasno patriotsko noto, kar je delno
                    prikrilo dejstvo, da je bila avgusta 1914 uvedena stroga cenzura razširjanja
                    informacij. Izredna zakonodaja, ki je bila sprejeta v obeh delih monarhije, je
                    oblastem dejansko omogočila uravnavanje javnega razpoloženja, če je to preseglo
                    sprejemljive parametre. V prvih mesecih se to ni zdelo tako nujno glede na javne
                    čustvene izlive, vendar so za kulisami potekale tudi množične aretacije, zlasti
                    južno- in vzhodnoslovanskih osumljencev. Šele pozneje so se v dnevnikih,
                    spominih in državnih dokumentih razkrili tudi negativnejši vidiki "duha leta
                    1914": tisti, ki so bili pesimistični glede izida vojne in sovražno nastrojeni
                    do državnega patriotizma, zlasti pa tisti, ki jih je za sabo potegnila državna
                    pobuda s podporo vplivnih krogov. Za številne vojake je bila pot na fronto
                    potovanje v neznano in zato mogoče celo razburljiva pustolovščina. Duh leta 1914
                    se je zanje spremenil, ko so izkusili ognjeni krst na fronti in grozote "območja
                    smrti", ki so popolnoma preoblikovale njihov pogled na svet. Nasprotno se je
                    začetno navdušenje večine civilistov na domači fronti poleglo malo pozneje, ko
                    so prispeli prvi seznami žrtev in so se na njihova območja začeli zatekati
                    begunci z vzhoda in juga. Za vse na vojaških in domačih frontah se je začel boj
                    za preživetje, ko so se sovražnosti razvile v "totalno vojno". Ljudje so svoje
                    poglede prilagodili novim pričakovanjem, kaj bi jim država morala zagotoviti ob
                    koncu spopada. Habsburški režim pa se je moral ukvarjati z vprašanjem, kako
