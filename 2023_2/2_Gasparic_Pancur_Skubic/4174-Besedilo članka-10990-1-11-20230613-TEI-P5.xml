                <p style="text-align:justify"><hi rend="italic">Evroskpeticizem je eden najbolj
                        perečih problemov tako držav članic Evropske unije, kot tudi držav v
                        postopku približevanja EU. Splošno javno mnenje, zaradi katerega se med EU
                        in njenimi prebivalci in prebivalkami pojavlja vedno večji razkorak, se giblje v smeri, da
                        je Evropska unija ogromno kolesje birokracije, ki je kot tako oddaljeno od
                        resničnih problemov ljudi in mu zato ne gre zaupati. Mešane občutke glede
                        približevanja EU je bilo v času njene osamosvojitve in začetkov njenega
                        približevanja čutiti tudi v Sloveniji, kjer je bilo javno mnenje o EU dokaj
                        nizko. Slovenke in Slovenci so načeloma gojili pozitiven sentiment do EU,
                        vendar pa nad njo nikdar niso bili popolnoma navdušeni. Dodatne dvome je v
                        ljudeh zbujalo tudi dejstvo, da je takratna politika sprejela ogromno
                        odločitev in različne regulative, ki jih vnaprej ni komunicirala z javnostjo oziroma
                        javnosti o svojem delu ni redno obveščala. V tem prispevku zagovarjamo tezo,
                        da je reprezentativna demokracija ni najbolj ogrožena takrat, ko politične
                        obljube ostanejo neizpolnjene, pač pa takrat, ko političarke in politiki
                        naredijo več, kot obljubijo, a o tem ne informirajo javnosti. V prispevku z
                        analizo volilnih programov, javnega mnenja in medijskih objav analiziramo
                        dva glavna problema slovenske vlade med letoma 2000 in 2004. Prvi problem
                        zaznamo v skoraj avtomatičnem in rutinskem sprejemanju regulativ in politik
                        EU in hkrati evidentnem umanjkanju javnih debat. Drugi problem pa vidimo
                        predvsem v nezmožnosti vlade, da bi o svojih odločitvah dosledno informirala
                        zainteresirano javnost in svoje odločitve približala ljudem. Čeprav
                        analiziramo dogodke, ki so se v Sloveniji dogajali več kot 20 let nazaj pa
                        ugotavljamo, da je raziskava izjemno relevantna tudi za trenutno dogajanje v
                        slovenski politiki. </hi></p>

                <p style="text-align:justify"><hi rend="italic">Euroscepticism is a common political
                        problem in many EU member states as well as potential candidates. There is a
                        general belief that the EU is a giant bureaucratic organization far removed
                        from peoples’ actual needs and everyday problems and therefore not to be
                        trusted. Such ambivalent sentiment towards the EU could also be noticed in
                        Slovenia after it gained independence from Yugoslavia and started the EU
                        accession process. General public opinion was rather low – people were
                        generally sympathetic but never completely enthusiastic about the EU. What
                        attributed to this attitude was the fact that politicians adopted several
                        regulations without properly informing the public, therefore leaving people
                        with little or no knowledge concerning potentially important issues. In this
                        paper, we argue that the threat to representative democracy is not so much
                        about politicians not keeping their promises but rather about politicians
                        not telling their constituents what they are working on and doing even more
                        than promised by adopting more regulations than those communicated to the
                        public. Our analysis of election manifestos, public opinion and press
                        releases uncovers two fundamental problems of the Slovenian government
                        between 2000 and 2004. The first is an almost routine adoption of EU
                        regulations without serious public debate and the second government’s
                        consistent failure to communicate relevant matters and therefore bring them
                        closer to the electorate. Although the analysis focuses on events that happened 20 years ago, we believe that our findings are highly relevant for the
                        state of Slovenian politics today. </hi></p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p style="text-align:justify">On July 1, 2017, legendary Irish musician and activist
                    Bob Geldof visited Slovenia as part of the Lent Festival in Maribor. This was at
                    the time of Brexit, and Geldof was resigned and critical in his opinion both
                    about the political situation in Europe and worldwide:</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">"I am not sceptical about Europe, as I have been
                    intimately involved with it for more than thirty years. With all European
                    leaders. I have been to Brussels countless times. Brussels is shit. It is a
                    colossal bureaucracy. But maybe it has to exist to reconcile all the differences
                    in Europe. Also, nationalisms and national identities. Personally, I think the
                    EU functions based on the French being afraid of the Germans and the Germans
                    being afraid of themselves. Meanwhile, the English are always, at least
                    seemingly, somewhere in the mix.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="1">Aleš

                <p style="text-align:justify">In the style of a punk musician, Geldof uttered
                    comprehensible and resounding criticism that was met with much approval. His
                    words were almost in tune with the popular wisdom that Europe is fine but
                    essentially colossal, distant and therefore not to be trusted. The thoughts
                    expressed during Brexit, which for many represented yet another European crisis,
                    were basically no different from the judgments already heard throughout Central
                    and Eastern Europe at the time of EU accession and in the first years as new
                    members of the EU. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">In the first EU elections after the fifth enlargement
                    of the European Union (EU) when ten new countries joined in the so called “big
                    bang” accession in 2004, many people shared the opinion of the Czech man when
                    asked by a BBC reporter on the streets of Prague, whether he had voted: “I
                    didn’t. I am against the European Union for several reasons. I don’t believe
                    giant bureaucratic structures can help their member nations.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="2"> Brane Kastelic, “Evropa v 2004: ne samo leto širitve,”

                <p style="text-align:justify">The 2004 elections focused mainly on national issues,
                    resulting in the lowest voter turnout in the history of EU elections and
                    revealing a growing distance between citizens and EU institutions. As shown in
                    Table 1, a downward trend in turnout in EU elections has been observed since

                    issues related to the image of the EU. The "ambivalent mood" towards the Union
                    that journalists and politicians often observe in Eastern European member states may have divisive consequences. Especially after Brexit, concerns about
                    the future fate of the EU are becoming more frequent (although at present they

                    about its organizations, laws and practices. It is in opposition to European

                    institutions declined sharply between 2004 and 2015. Although after 2016 the
                    number of people doubting the EU started to decrease, the percentage of those
                    doubting the institutions was still high. This can be attributed to several
                    factors. The most important is the belief that EU integration undermines
                    national sovereignty, that the EU is elitist, bureaucratic and wasteful, and
                    that it lacks transparency and democratic legitimacy.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="7">Juliette Alibert, "Euroscepticism: the root causes and

                    aspect of European integration to full condemnation of the European ideal. Yet
                    the recent situation in the EU has reawakened the academic debate, which has

                <p style="text-align:justify">The influence of public opinion is one of the key
                    drivers in the EU and has become increasingly important in recent decades. It is
                    not only crucial for the discussion on European integration, but also influences
                    national policy makers and shapes the EU institutions.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="9">Robert Alvarez, "Attitudes toward the European Union:

                <p style="text-align:justify">The general attitude towards the EU can be observed
                    through opinion polls (through the study of public opinion in Slovenia –
                    Slovensko javno mnenje - SJM VI), and the impact of public opinion is similar to
                    the sentiment expressed by Geldof. We can observe that people were generally
                    sympathetic to the EU, but never completely enthusiastic about it. They were
                    often sceptical, partly out of concern for their own position and well-being.

                    that it would be in our country's interest to follow the path of other (Western)

                <p style="text-align:justify">The ambivalent attitude towards the EU is evident from
                    Table 2, which clearly shows that almost 22% of respondents believe that
                    Slovenia would not benefit from joining the EU. Moreover, almost 29% did not
                    have a clear opinion on Slovenia’s EU integration, which means that more than
                    half of the respondents were not very optimistic about integration. The high
                    percentage of respondents who did not have a clear opinion on integration also
                    indicates that they may be missing some important information about integration
                    and therefore undecided about what this means. Hand in hand with these findings,
                    the results from Table 4 also clearly show that more than half of the
                    respondents would neither regret nor care if Slovenia’s efforts to join the EU
                    failed. This reinforces the assumption that public opinion about Slovenia's EU
                    accession was rather low and did not support integration.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The problem of insufficient information being
                    available to the public is also evident from Table 3, which shows that when
                    asked about other EU accession candidates, approximately 33% of respondents
                    could not name any state other than Slovenia that was on the path to EU
                    accession. In addition, four states that were negotiating membership at the time
                    (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta) were not mentioned as candidates for
                    accession and Croatia, not a serious candidate for EU accession at the time,
                    because it did not begin negotiations until 2003, was recognized as a state
                    negotiating accession.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The above-mentioned ambiguous or often negative
                    attitude towards the EU, as well as the lack of information, can also be
                    observed in responses about Slovenia’s development in case of non-accession to
                    the EU. About half of the respondents believe that Slovenia could develop just
                    as well if it were not part of the EU, and another 19% of the respondents were
                    not able to comment directly. Only about 30% of respondents felt that Slovenia
                    would not develop if EU integration did not take place.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The argument about indifference is therefore not
                    tenable either as many people are aware that funding for development of their
                    municipalities comes from Brussels and that mayors are powerless without
                    cohesion funds as indicated by the Opinion Poll on EU Accession conducted by
                        Tavčar.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn16" n="11">Rudi Tavčar, “Mnenjska

                <p style="text-align:justify">Considering the above findings, we believe that
                    additional research should be invested into a thorough investigation of the
                    reasons for doubts about the EU and ambiguous or negative feelings about EU
                    accession.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">In the context of the present discussion, we will use
                    the example of Slovenia to explain attitudes towards the EU with the help of
                    contemporary populist theories and the thesis that the gap between the elites
                    and the general public is becoming ever more present and evident. According to
                    Cas Mudde, there are no politics for populists because the will of the people is
                    clear and all people are one, so there is no need for compromise. At the same
                    time, however, all decisions must coincide with "the common will of the people"
                    - which is not the case, because the elites decide everything. Thus, populists
                    are in effect demanding re-politicization and the right to decide on everything,
                    while established politics transfer more and more tasks to experts, expert
                    groups and bureaucratic battalions and in many cases resorts to TINA (There Is
                    No Alternative) argument. Liberal parliamentary democracy is thus, according to
                    the populists, becoming less and less democratic.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn17" n="12">Cas Mudde, "The populist zeitgeist," <hi rend="italic">Government and
                        Opposition</hi> 39, No. 4 (2004): 541-63.</note></p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The latter is particularly evident in the case of the
                    EU, where Eurosceptic parties in the European Parliament argue precisely that
                    decisions taken in Brussels in the past would not have met with the approval of
                    the people if they had been better informed. The real problem, then, may be that
                    European policy issues are not part of the domestic political spectrum and that
                    not enough politicians talk about them and address the electorate.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The above observation is confirmed by a brief look at
                    the corpora available in Slovenia, which has not changed significantly (see, for
                    example, politicians' tweets 2013-2017).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="13">

                    results. When it comes to the EU, "funds" (Slovenian: sredstva) are the main
                    topic. However, European issues encompass much more than just funds.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify">We decided to take a closer look at the actions of
                        the elected political elite during the last Slovenian government term before
                        EU accession (2000-2004) - what they promised domestically and in relation
                        to Europe, and what they achieved. In doing so, we made partial use of
                        classical descriptive analysis, while the core of the research focused on
                        quantitative analysis of data from the political process. We conducted a

                    <p style="text-align:justify">In relation to the above research questions, our
                        main thesis is that democracy is threatened by politicians delivering more
                        than they promise. We believe that it is not so much the unfulfilled
                        promises that are the problem (although we often perceive them as such), but
                        rather decisions taken that were neither promised nor communicated by the
                        government. We believe that most politics takes place behind closed doors
                        and away from the public, which provides politicians an ideal opportunity to
                        circumvent the "will" of the public. Therefore, we expect to see many
                        decisions, regulations and policies that were not covered (or only partially
                        and vaguely covered) in previous promises, but then actually implemented by
                        the government. In other words, we claim that the number of decisions and
                        regulations that are not part of election promises increases with the
                        distance to the point where the parties directly address the electorate. We
                        propose that a gap between the policies that parties directly address (or
                        inform voters about) and the decisions that are then taken may be at the
                        core of distrust in the EU and is responsible for the rise of populist
                        political patterns. Therefore, we believe this thesis is worth
                        exploring.</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">Advocating ideological positions is part of election
                    campaigns, and some parties succeed in communicating their positions much more

                    ideological positions, views and intentions is through the publication of
                    election manifestos. These are publications issued by political parties before
                    elections that contain a set of policies that the party stands for and intends
                    to implement if elected to government.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn23" n="18">UK Parliament, “Elections manifestos,” accessed May 10, 2023, <ref target="https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/manifesto/">https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/manifesto/</ref>.</note>
                    Manifestos, therefore, can be understood as a set of intentions, motives or
                    views of the political party, or the statement of its ideology and intentions,
                    designed to promote new ideas that are consistent with the party's political and
                    ideological positions. Various studies have shown that under certain conditions
                    there is a high degree of correlation between what parties feature in their
                    election manifestos and what governments then do.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn24" n="19">Robert Thomson, "Parties’ Elections Manifestos and

                    closer look at the last Slovenian elections before EU accession (in 2000), we
                    find that positive European attitudes were even more pronounced in all major
                    parties’ manifestos compared with the 1996 elections. Most parties emphasized
                    the importance of membership for the country's economic and social development
                    and security. The functioning of the EU itself and its legal framework were not
                    examined in detail. In the following elections (2004), reference to the EU in
                    election programs continued to have a legitimizing function. The parties used it
                    to justify the correctness of their positions. A more visible integration of
                    European issues with clear positions took place in the following years, but its
                    importance remained low for a long time.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn27" n="22">Simona Kustec Lipicer, Samo Kropivnik, Tomaž Deželan and Alem Maksuti. <hi rend="italic">Volilni programi in stališča</hi> (Ljubljana: Fakulteta za

                <p style="text-align:justify">Even though electoral manifestos are the most
                    "rational" instruments of electoral campaigns and are therefore considered the
                    most appropriate material for analysis and form the substantive basis for the
                    actions of the parties and later the government, they will not be the focus of
                    our analysis. Rather, we are interested in the following two issues: 1) the
                    actual share of European issues in the policy-making and decision-making
                    process, and above all, 2) their communication impact.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify">On Sunday, October 15, 2000, Slovenia held
                        parliamentary elections, preceded by another campaign in which commentators
                        and MPs assessed the second term and the established parties and public
                        figures made appearances. Although these elections took place at the turning
                        point of the decade, the century and the millennium, they did not in
                        themselves represent an important milestone. Symbolically, however, they
                        marked the beginning of a new era. The first decade after the fall of the
                        Berlin Wall, which the "best chronicler of the 20th century," British
                        historian Timothy Garton Ash, called the "age of freedom," came to an end,
                        and the new "nameless decade," an elusive period of ambiguous character,
                        began. A year earlier, the common European currency (EURO) was introduced,
                        and NATO was enlarged to include the first three Eastern European countries,
                        which had a special significance for the integration processes. The
                        following year, on October 5, 2000 - just ten days before Slovenian
                        elections - the last Yugoslav tyrant, Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević, was
                        deposed in Belgrade. All this can be seen as historical censorship of a
                        particular era.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn28" n="23">Becoming a Republic.

                    <p style="text-align:justify">The Slovenian Liberal Democracy (LDS), which
                        played the leading role during transition and with one brief exception, was
                        the strongest party in the government, won the elections for the last time.
                        The right-wing parties suffered a heavy defeat and LDS, which also strongly
                        supported EU accession, received an astonishing 36.21 % of the votes. The
                        orientation of the leading political parties took a strong left-liberal
                        turn, mainly due to non-consolidation of parties in the right-wing political
                        spectrum and various disagreements between them. Drnovšek's LDS party
                        therefore won, securing 34 seats in parliament. It formed a coalition with
                        three other parties (United List of Social Democrats (ZLSD), Slovenian
                        People’s Party (SLS) and Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia
                            (DeSUS))<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn29" n="24">Ibidem.</note> and
                        signed a special agreement with the Slovenian Youth Party (SMS). This
                        secured 62 seats for all five parties in a 90-seat parliament, accounting
                        for 2/3 of all seats and providing them with a comfortable parliamentary
                            majority.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn30" n="25">Andrej Bizjak, “Vpliv

                    <p style="text-align:justify">Nevertheless, the coalition formed in 2000 was,
                        along with the 1996 coalition, one of the least homogeneous coalitions in
                        the short period of Slovenia's independence. According to political
                        scientists' calculations, the average Euclidean distance between the
                        analyzed coalition partners (5) manifestos and the coalition agreement was
                        more than 30. On the other hand, the agreement was the most extensive ever
                        written, as it contained more than 36,000 words and unlike previous
                        agreements, also included a separate chapter entitled Integration into the

                        The election posters - at that time still relevant for the promotion of
                        parties - were monotonous, uncreative and above all, similar to each other.
                        The Internet campaign was still in its infancy and "showed a clear lack of
                        an online strategy." It was mainly carried out by party sympathizers, which
                        is why it was of little significance. The traditional media - press and
                        television - were at the forefront. In this respect, the analysis of the
                        confrontations on TV showed that the media depended on the political
                        "construction of problems." The issues they focused on were based on what
                        journalists had expressed in previous months and years. They reported on
                        what politicians said and, on that basis, shaped media discourse. In this
                        way, the media defined the issues dictated by politicians as the most
                        important national political issues, unconsciously adopting their language
                        and conceptual framework as well. Breda Luthar, in her analysis of TV
                        confrontations, argued convincingly that these issues and their language
                        were limited to "consensus issues on government policy."<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn33" n="28">Breda Luthar, "Oslepljeni in ohromljeni od

                            </hi>201-12.</note> What were the issues about? They mainly revolved
                        around the budget gap, funding for science, relations with successor states
                        of Yugoslavia, and of course, EU accession. The issues were clear and
                        consensus-oriented, while the recognition of a particular point was the only
                        source of conflict. Thus, the public was given the impression of the
                        "inevitability of accession" in relation to the EU. This was the dominant
                        narrative of all parties (except SNS) and the mainstream media.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">Overall, the campaign was empty of content and
                        limited to slogans and the mindset of TINA. It was characterized by a lack
                        of short and clear political messages addressing individual elements of EU
                        accession. Views regarding the EU were largely reduced to the phrase: "We
                        should integrate, but at the same time defend our own interests." The
                        latter, however, was not reflected in media discourse. Media coverage of the
                        negotiation process was technical, similar to legal acts from Brussels, and
                        reduced the accession country to the role of a student busily performing
                        tasks, sometimes praised (e.g., you are making good progress), and sometimes
                        blamed (e.g., your structural reforms are too hesitant, you are too slow in
                        selling state-owned enterprises, etc.).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn34" n="29">Božo Mašanovič, “Do vstopa v EU še veliko dela,” <hi rend="italic">Slovenski almanah</hi> (2001): 23–24.</note></p>

                        setting out the main tasks for each period and the deadlines. The program
                        was prepared in accordance with the guidelines set out in the coalition
                        agreement and, in the government's words, was "oriented towards the most
                        important tasks related to Slovenia's accession to the European Union." Many
                        of the legal acts to be amended for EU accession were on the agenda, but
                        without any explanation of what exactly was being changed and why. The
                        program only contained explanations of the legislation that was not directly
                        related to EU accession. Once again, TINA can be observed.</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">After gaining independence from Yugoslavia, Slovenia became a parliamentary democratic republic where the power belongs to the people. However, the basis for a successful democracy is that the general
                    public is consistently transparently informed about the actions of the
                        government.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn39" n="34">Jenille Fairbanks,

                    discussing important policy decisions or deciding on significant political
                    issues (e.g., accession to the EU). Governing, therefore, necessarily involves a
                    constant exchange of information and communication about policies, ideas and
                    decisions between the governing and the governed<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn40" n="35">Karen Sanders and María José Canel, <hi rend="italic">Government communication: Cases and challenges</hi> (London: Bloomsbury

                    also about what politicians do and how they keep their campaign promises.
                    However, government communicators often fail to inform the public about key
                    policy decisions and what politicians are actually doing. We see this as a
                    serious threat to democracy, as the public is not informed about the content of
                    government activities.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Our analysis shows two fundamental problems of the
                    Slovenian government in the period from 2000 to 2004. The first problem is the
                    almost automatic and routine adoption of EU regulations without serious public
                    debate. This observation can be deduced from the above data, which show that the
                    government completed only a limited amount of EU-related tasks and that
                    regulations were indeed adopted routinely. We can see, for example, that the
                    program does not contain any meaningful communication besides the frequent There
                    Is No Alternative (TINA) argumentation. This clearly shows the attitude of
                    Slovenian political parties towards the EU; Slovenia's accession to the EU is
                    seen as inevitable and politicians would like to show that they are prepared to
                    do whatever is necessary for integration. It can be assumed that the
                    government's communication officers acted in this way deliberately and after
                    careful consideration, as they wanted to create the impression that Slovenia is
                    acting as a "good student" on the road to EU integration.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The second problem is that the public was not informed
                    about the actual work of the Slovenian government. The government failed to
                    communicate relevant matters in a timely manner, to address any negative aspects
                    and by doing so bring them closer to their constituents. The public was only
                    informed after the government had adopted the regulations. As a result, public
                    debate failed to materialize, and the EU remained a large bureaucratic
                    organization that was at the forefront of the government's activities, but
                    without content for the public. The main impression was that many regulations
                    regarding the EU were passed without the public being informed about what was
                    actually decided. Such a lack of communication and information creates a
                    breeding ground for the development of populist policies, as "the people" (who
                    are the main point of reference for populists) will eventually no longer
                    tolerate them. And the general characteristics of the 2000-2004 legislative
                    period strongly support this thesis and findings.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">It should also be noted that the main issues discussed
                    in public were not related to the process of European integration, but to areas
                    that were the focus of ideological-political disputes. For example, one of the
                    most notorious parliamentary debates of the third term was concerning medically
                    assisted infertility treatment. After the introduction of the Act on Infertility
                    Treatment and Fertilization Procedures with Biomedical Assistance,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn42" n="37">

                    ideological and moral differences became evident in the Slovenian parliament,
                    leading to several political statements that had mostly negative connotations in
                    public. Moreover, the issue of "national interest" in the economy was one of the
                    main reasons for several confrontations between Prime Minister Janez Drnovšek
                    and opposition leader Janez Janša. The latter claimed that the government
                    neglects the "national interest" and is ineffective when it comes to the sale of
                    Slovenian companies to foreign investors. Such debates raised several questions,
                    such as "What does national interest mean anyway?" and "Does the term presuppose
                    a majority domestic shareholding in the capital?" As a result, parliamentary
                    debates were often extremely discordant, cynical and combative, which was
                    particularly evident on the issue of the "erased," a topic that at its core,
                    reveals the dark side of Slovenian transition. After gaining independence in
                    1991, citizens of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia were automatically granted
                    Slovenian citizenship, while those who came from other republics of the
                    Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) had the opportunity to apply for
                    citizenship within a period of six months. However, those who for whatever
                    reason, did not apply for citizenship in time, or if their application was
                    rejected for whatever reason, were removed from the population register by the
                    Slovenian state, depriving them of all their constitutional rights.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn43" n="38">Izbrisani: informacije in dokumenti, “Kaj

                <p style="text-align:justify">The split between the coalition and the opposition
                    continued to intensify even after Janez Drnovšek resigned from the post of Prime
                    Minister and was appointed President of the Republic. However, one of the few
                    issues that united almost all deputies was their stance on EU accession and
                    joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). As a result, the National
                    Assembly had no difficulty passing the necessary harmonization laws and amending
                    the constitution in February 2003. According to the two presidents of the
                    Assembly, Borut Pahor and Feri Horvat, "much was achieved in terms of the scope
                    of the work, and it was also important in terms of its content." This is
                    certainly true, but the problem that most of the provisions were not disclosed
                    to the public remained at the forefront.</p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p style="text-align:justify">In public debates about politics, it is often argued
                    that democracy is severely compromised primarily because politicians often fail
                    to keep their (pre-election) promises, that what is said or promised is rarely
                    addressed in parliament and that politicians do little and live off the people.
                    Such arguments suggest that many citizens are fundamentally misinformed about
                    the range of political issues and political figures, leading to misconceptions
                    about the work of politicians.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn44" n="39">Michael
                        D. Cobb, Brendan Nyhan, and Jason Reifler, "Beliefs don't always persevere:
                        How political figures are punished when positive information about them is
                        discredited," <hi rend="italic">Political Psychology</hi> 34, No. 3 (2013):
                        307-26.</note> We argue that the real problem and threat to representative
                    democracy is not the incompetence of politicians, nor the work they do not
                    perform but rather the work they do but about which the public is not informed.
                    We show that in addition to what they promise, politicians are involved in many
                    other activities that the public are not aware of. They pass countless
                    resolutions and regulations that are not discussed in real terms during the
                    election campaign but are wrapped up in a few uninformative phrases that often
                    go unnoticed or unintentionally ignored by the public. We see a crucial problem
                    in the fact that politicians are often very busy informing the public about
                    regulations and decisions when they have already been passed and they do not
                    discuss them beforehand.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">After this analysis, we see that our initial thesis
                    that democracy is threatened by the fact that politicians deliver more than they
                    promise should be modified by the following observation: European issues were
                    omnipresent in Slovenian politics and imbued with positive sentiments, but they
                    lacked substance in communications with voters. By passing European laws, the
                    government tried to win over voters. It communicated the regulations more
                    frequently than usual and assigned them a central role, but only after they had
                    been passed. This was because, despite the voters' feelings and thoughts, as
                    responsible politicians they had no other alternative to the EU. It must be
                    noted, however, that the mentality of "no matter what the voters think" can
                    sometimes be dangerous, as recent social media attacks on the German foreign
                    minister clearly show.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn45" n="40">German foreign
                        minister Annalena Baerbock, without regard to the opinion of the German
                        public and against the opinion of her constituents, reiterated the support
                        she had already pledged to Ukraine during Russia's aggression against
                        Ukraine. This pledge was followed by a fierce smear campaign in which many
                        voters expressed their distrust and dissatisfaction with the foreign
                        minister primarily because she "does not represent the interests of German
                        voters, but those of Ukraine." However, the video of her statement was
                        manipulated, and this manipulation was fueled by pro-Russian disinformation
                        and cyber activism, as her statement was taken out of context in such a way
                        that it falsely reinforced anti-German sentiments. (Sabine am Orde,

                <p style="text-align:justify">Our initial thesis, therefore, is that the adopted
                    regulations are the sum of the difference between election promises and
                    unfulfilled election promises on the one hand and regulations that are not part
                    of the election promises on the other. In other words, the adopted regulations
                    consist of the fulfilled campaign promises and the regulations that were not
                    part of the campaign promises, the latter being a variable that is more
                    important than campaign promises and fulfilled campaign promises. When the
                    thesis is corrected, it remains essentially the same, with the only difference
                    being the definition of regulations that are not part of pre-election promises.
                    In the corrected thesis, these regulations are defined as a variable that
                    receives much attention from government communicators but is often not
                    communicated to the public.</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">Our analysis therefore focuses on regulations that are
                    not part of the electoral promises but are nevertheless part of the politicians'
                    program and their work. According to our initial conjectures, such schemes and
                    deliberate miscommunication pose a serious threat to representative democracy,
                    as they imply that politicians are working on issues and actions that were not
                    included in their manifestos and therefore constituents are simply not aware.
                    Moreover, we show that the threat to democracy is exacerbated by the fact that
                    the public is informed only after regulations have already been passed and
                    important policy decisions have already been made. This creates a sense among
                    voters that their opinions do not matter and that their voices are heard and
                    "made "useful" only when politicians need them to get elected.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Although our analysis refers to the period of
                    Slovenia's EU integration (one of the most important periods in Slovenian
                    political history) almost 20 years ago, we believe that our results are even
                    more meaningful today. Politics have indeed taken an interesting turn, where
                    mainstream media coverage is often replaced or intertwined by posts from
                    politicians on social media, which especially before elections, are filled with
                    promises, ideas and plans, if elected. Therefore, it would be interesting to
                    conduct similar research today, not focusing on “traditional” media, but
                    analyzing the activities of the most prominent Slovenian coalition and
                    opposition politicians in social media. We believe that such a study would
                    provide a useful insight into the development of politics and how much this
                    differs from politics during the period of Slovenian independence and EU
                    accession.</p>

                <head>NAŠA EVROPSKA POLITIKA ZA ZAPRTIMI VRATI: VZROKI EVROSKEPTIZICMA V
                    SLOVENIJI</head>
                <head>POVZETEK</head>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Avtorji v prispevku naslavljajo perečo tematiko
                    evroskeptizima in analizirajo vzroke, ki so pripomogli k dvomom glede
                    pridruževanja Slovenije Evropski uniji. V času po osamosvojitvi leta 1991 je
                    Slovenija postala demokratična republika v kateri ima oblast ljudstvo, njegovo
                    voljo pa izpolnjujejo demokratično izvoljeni političarke in politiki. V svojih
                    volilnih programih se političarke in politiki zapišejo svoje aktivnosti in
                    obljube v primeru izvolitve ter programe tako uporabljajo za nagovarjanje volivk
                    in volivcev. Pogosto pa se zgodi, da po eni strain volilne obljube ostanejo
                    neizpolnjene, po drugi strani pa političarke in politiki delajo veliko več,
                    vendar o tem ne obveščajo javnosti. Avtorji v prispevku postavijo tezo, da
                    glavne grožnje reprezentativni demokraciji ne predstavljajo toliko neizpolnjene
                    politične obljube, pač pa dejstvo, da so političarke in politiki bolj aktivni in
                    delajo veliko več, kot je komunicirano z javnostjo. To se je jasno pokazalo v
                    analizi medijskih objav, ki so se v veliki večini primerov bolj kot na objave o
                    delu povezanem z evropsko integracijo navezovale na druge tematike, s katerimi
                    se je ukvarjala takratna politika. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Avtorji v svoji raziskavi izpostavijo dva glavna
                    problema slovenske politike med letoma 2000 in 2004. Prvi problem se nanaša na
                    skoraj rutinsko in avtomatično sprejemanje EU regulativ in zakonodaje, o katerih
                    javnost skorajda ni bila obveščena. Tako se je v javnosti ustvaril občutek, da
                    vlada integraciji Slovenije v EU ni povzročala veliko pozornosti, pa čeprav so
                    se veliko ukvarjali s tovrstno tematiko in integracijo tudi uspešno zaključili.
                    Drugi problem, ki ga izpostavijo avtorji, se kaže v dejstvu, da vladne
                    komunikacijske službe javnosti niso jasno informirale o pomembnih tematikah, jih
                    niso problematizirale in jih prav tako niso približale ljudem. Velikokrat je do
                    informiranja javnosti prišlo šele takrat, ko so bile odločitve že sprejete.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">V analizi so avtorji jasno opozorijo na problem
                    neinformiranja javnosti glede sprejemanja najpomemnejših političnih odločitev in
                    izspotavijo dejstvo, da je veliko političnih odločitev sprejetih brez vednosti
                    javnosti. Avtorji to vidijo kot izjemno problematično politično prakso, ki
                    predstavlja nevarnost za demokratično družbo, hkrati pa v javnosti ustvarja
                    občutek, da se politiki ne ukvarjajo z najpomembnejšimi problem v državi.
                    Avtorji ugotavljajotudi, da bi bila dotična analiza, čeprav se nanaša na
                    dogodke, ki so se dogajali več kot 20 let nazaj, relevantna tudi danes, predvsem
                    z vsepojavnostjo družbenih omrežij, ki so povzročili, da se je dobršen del
                    politčne komunikacije preselil tja.</p>
