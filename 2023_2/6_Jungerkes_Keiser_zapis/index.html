What remains controversial, however, is the question of what long-term consequences the transfer of West German party structures had for the emergence of a democratic culture in the territory of the former GDR, respectively Germany as a whole. In view of the recruitment of political leadership controlled by the party headquarters of the old Federal German Republic and the appointment of functionaries in the administration and judiciary who had been socialized in the West, was soon followed by discourse and allegations about colonization of the east. <span id="ftn5_return"><a class="notelink" title="See for example Dirk Oschmann, Der Osten: eine westdeutsche Erfindung (Berlin: Ullstein, 2023).

The 90s and early 2000s was a period in which the internal structures of the nationally established parties reshaped. After the decision to make Berlin the capital of a unified Germany, party headquarters began to move organizations and structures from Bonn to Berlin. Even before the unification they had already begun founding East German state associations or appointing representatives for the east. This period of upheaval during the first years of unification was not easy or free from conflict. A common parliamentary practice between GDR politicians, who often had little experience in politics as a profession, and West German professional politicians had yet to be found. And even today one can still see great differences in mentality between East and West that has led to a different style of politics in the east. <span id="ftn6_return"><a class="notelink" title="See Jahresbericht der Bundesregierung zum Stand der Deutschen Einheit 2021, ed. German Federal Government (Bundestag Drucksache 19/31840), 14, 15." href="#ftn6"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p><p id="index-p-d46e166"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>This new, all-German party system was slightly different from the old Federal German Republic. This became significantly visible during the protests against the so-called Hartz IV reforms, which since 2002 (the second government of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, a coalition of Social Democrats and the Green Party, 2002–2005) have been restructuring the former West German social welfare system which was extended to East Germany.<span id="ftn7_return"><a class="notelink" title="For the extension see Gerhard Albert Ritter, Der Preis der deutschen Einheit: die Wiedervereinigung und dieKrise des Sozialstaats. 2., Erweiterte Aufl…" href="#ftn7"><sup>5</sup></a></span> The five new states became the focal point of vehement citizen protests against the reforms, which severely restricted social benefits. In the West, left-wing groups and trade union representatives split from the ruling Social Democrats and, together with former communist or socialist splinter groups, merged to form a new party, which positioned itself left of the Social Democrats and called itself an electoral alternative for labor and social justice WASG ( Wahlalternative Arbeit und Soziale Gerechtigkeit). Thanks to the protests, the former Socialist Unity Party of the east, now renamed the PDS Party of Democratic Socialism (Partei des Demokratischen Sozialismus), which was mainly confined to eastern Germany and in sharp decline. For example, the PDS fell short of the 5-percent threshold in the 2002 elections for the Bundestag and was therefore no longer represented in the new Bundestag. But with growing protest against the labor market reforms the PDS, which rejected the reforms, managed to gain new supporters and establish itself as an all-German new left-wing party that merged with the WASG in 2007. In 2005, the PDS renamed itself The Left ( Die Linke) <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">, </span>returned to the Bundestag with a gain of almost five percentage points.</p><p id="index-p-d46e179"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>So, in short, the reference framework for the planned studies is, on the one hand, the change in the party landscape after the end of the Cold War in Europe as a whole and on the other hand, the specifically German manifestations of the system transformation.</p></section><section class="teidiv0" id="index-body.1_div.2"><header><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head">The Historical Background </span></h2></header><p id="index-p-d46e182"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The understanding of democracy and voter behavior in the new and old federal states differed from the outset, even though the parties represented in the state parliaments since 1990 consistently competed nationwide. Thus, the East German electorate and also the East German local party milieus were primarily shaped by the experience of the political system of the GDR. However, this experience was not universally negative: In surveys conducted as early as 1991, almost two-thirds of respondents thought that GDR socialism was a good idea, but that it had been poorly executed. Especially in view of social upheavals after reunification, deindustrialization and mass unemployment in East Germany, the GDR appeared ambivalent: Lack of freedom on the one hand, steady jobs and a stable social system on the other.<span id="ftn8_return"><a class="notelink" title="The historian Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk pointed out that the GDR-ideology and self-perception, but also its citizens, defined itself in social reality as …" href="#ftn8"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p><p id="index-p-d46e191"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The lack of pluralism also characterized the GDR's party system. Although different parties existed in the GDR, the voter did not have a real choice. There was only a single list on the ballot: the so called National Front (Nationale Front), in which candidates from all approved eastern German parties and mass organizations like the trade unions were placed. The allocation of mandates was arranged by a fixed distribution key that guaranteed a majority for the SED Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands),. So, the self-proclaimed leading role of the GDR's Socialist Unity Party, effectively ruled out any claim to power by the bloc parties, which on paper formally had equal rights. But GDR-parties such as the CDU Christian Democrats (Christlich Demokratische Union), LDPD Liberal Democrats (Liberaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands), the NDPD National Democrats (Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands or the DBD Democratic Farmers’ Party (Demokratische Bauernpartei Deutschlands) had primarily a legitimizing and integrating function <span id="ftn9_return"><a class="notelink" title="For example, the NDPD integrated former ordinary Members of the banned National Socialist Party." href="#ftn9"><sup>7</sup></a></span>; they allowed the illusion of plurality that did not exist in reality, they were able to render possible protests or dissatisfaction harmless. Critics of the SED's leadership role were able to become involved, without endangering the dominance of the Socialist Unity Party. So, the bloc parties were seen as a system-stabilizing factor.<span id="ftn10_return"><a class="notelink" title="Cf. for example Ines Soldwisch, „... etwas für das ganze Volk zu leisten und nicht nur den Zielen einer Partei dienen ...“: Geschichte der Liberal-Dem…" href="#ftn10"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p><p id="index-p-d46e203"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>In contrast, the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany (Grundgesetz) accorded constitutional status to all political parties that were loyal to the constitution in Article 21, paragraph 1: “The parties shall cooperate in the formation according to the political will of the people.” Political competition between different parties was fundamental to the political system of the Federal Republic and was an elementary factor for the electorate's understanding of democracy. Such party competition did not become established in the GDR until the very last period of the state’s existence: the phase in which the state party, the SED, slowly lost importance against the backdrop of growing protests among the population. Only towards the end of the GDR, did parties represented in the National Front bloc develop into potential power factors, but in the end missed their chance. This development began towards the end of the 9th Volkskammer, which in June 1986 was still elected on the basis of non-free elections with unified lists. The more the power of the SED eroded, the stronger the influence of the old bloc parties on the process of system transformation became at times. This was mainly due to the fact that the GDR's bloc parties were established and had material infrastructure – for example, members, a party organization, municipal officeholders or real estate holdings. Nevertheless, democratic change in the GDR did not come from the bloc parties; they only reacted and at no point did they succeed in gaining an initiative against the SED or in the reform process. Resistance to the system originated from outside the system. It formed itself in the mid-1980s against the SED's monopoly on power and the bloc parties that were integrated into the SED's system of rule.</p><p id="index-p-d46e204"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>However, the heterogeneous opposition, which initially developed primarily in the protective environment of the Protestant Church, for the most part did not see itself in the role of a competing party. It legitimized its existence primarily as a civil citizens' movement separate to political parties. It was not until the founding of the DDR/SDP Social Democratic Party of the GDR ( Sozialdemokratische Partei) in a Protestant parsonage in Schwante, a little Brandenburg village north of Berlin, on October 7, 1989, and other newly formed parties such as the DSU German Social Union (Deutsche Soziale Union), which was oriented towards the Bavarian Christian-Social Union, and the DA Democratic Awakening (Demokratischer Aufbruch), which was more or less the east German version of the western Christian Democratic Union, that the existing bloc party system of the National Front was expanded and transformed into a democratic, pluralistic alternative. Thus, the process of disintegration of the power-maintaining system of the bloc parties became apparent. And slowly their western counterparts became involved and took over these organizations.</p></section><section class="teidiv0" id="index-body.1_div.3"><header><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head">State of Research</span></h2></header><p id="index-p-d46e207"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The process of the political post-1990 transformation in eastern Germany is well researched.

Largely unexplored, on the other hand, is the long-term impact that the transfer of West German party structures had and still has on the emergence of democratic culture in the territory of the former GDR. That this transfer of West German standards and structures was viewed quite controversially is shown, for example, by talk of “colonization” of the lifeworld in the East – in view of the recruitment of political leadership controlled by the party headquarters of the old Federal Republic and the broad appointment of functionaries socialized in the West, to state functions such as administration and the judiciary, such an accusation could not be entirely dismissed.</p></section><section class="teidiv0" id="index-body.1_div.4"><header><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head">Project Outline</span></h2></header><p id="index-p-d46e254"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The research project carried out by KGParl and the parties' foundations starts with the confrontation of different political experiences and expectations in East and West with regard to the reconstitution of the parties:</p><p id="index-p-d46e255"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Already in the first German democratic state level (Landtagswahlen), elections in the five new federal states, a significantly different East German variant of the previous West German party system was shaped, in which the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) was able to establish itself as a strong regional party., This provided a rallying point for all those who were not satisfied with the course of development in East Germany, while structural dominance of the mainstream parties Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, which still prevailed in the West (although already challenged by the successes of the Green Party), waned. Particular difficulties were experienced by the West German Liberal Party and, to a lesser extent, the Greens who were unable to establish a broad base in eastern parts of Germany up until the present day. Both parties were only able to gain regional political influence on government formation and opposition in the new states as small coalition partners.</p><p id="index-p-d46e256"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>In a second phase - beginning with the brief electoral success of the far-right DVU German People's Union (Deutsche Volksunion) in Saxony-Anhalt in 1998 and somewhat later in Brandenburg - the right-wing extremist protest potential also unfolded more dynamically in the party spectrum than in the West, further intensifying the fragmentation of the all-German party system and the East-West divide. In addition, special regional developments took place that made the East German states appear far from homogeneous in terms of party politics.</p><p id="index-p-d46e257"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>The time frame of the research project covers the phase of the constitution and consolidation of the parties after system transformation up to the reactions to the announcement of comprehensive, partly neoliberal social reforms under Agenda 2010<span id="ftn15_return"><a class="notelink" title="See also Footnote 5." href="#ftn15"><sup>13</sup></a></span> by the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. Since 2003 the so-called Hartz-IV shock was felt particularly strongly in the eastern German states, where far larger percentages of the population were dependent on state support payments than in the west. It is therefore not surprising that since the end of 2003 opposition to the liberalization of the labor market and the increase in state pressure on social benefit recipients led to mass protests against the federal government, first in the east and later also in the west. After initial hesitation, the West German-dominated trade unions, which were organized under the umbrella organization of the German Trade Union Confederation, also joined the protests. However, protests in West Germany never reached the quality and quantity of East German protests. Here, the labor market reforms became the focal point for long-term alienation of citizens from the party system and, in part, from the welfare state, which for many presented itself primarily as an intrusion into private lives.</p><p id="index-p-d46e262"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>In East Germany, the PDS Socialist Party in particular was able to position itself as an opponent to the Hartz IV reforms and consolidate its position as the East German regional and protest party. For the Social Democrats, the protests also marked a turning point, as the partly neoliberal social policies of the Red-Green federal government led to the reestablishment of the WASG Electoral Alternative Party, which was subsequently able to mobilize parts of the left wing of the Social Democrats around their former party chairman Oskar Lafontaine, who left the Social Democrats in 2005, and left-wing trade unionists who were dissatisfied with the federal government's pro-employer policies. In 2006, the WASG merged with the PDS, which one year earlier had renamed itself The Left (Die Linke), and the two together formed a renewed nationwide leftwing party. As a nationwide left-wing party, they regularly succeeded in overcoming the five-percent threshold in state elections in the West as well and after 2005 became a left-wing opposition party. <span id="ftn16_return"><a class="notelink" title="A position the Left is losing at the moment as the new populist party Alternative for Germany, a party that was initially founded as an anti-euro move…" href="#ftn16"><sup>14</sup></a></span> Nevertheless, even after unification with the WASG, the strong east-west division remained visible: In the West the party was never able to match the electoral successes it had in eastern parts of Germany, where today The Left holds the position of prime minister in Thuringia.

The private sphere has become political in a new and different way, in that the formation of political will in society is no longer oriented towards programmatic “offers” of parties or social elite discourses, but primarily follows personal experiences or perceptions of reality circulated by social media. In this sense, communication between voters, the local party base and full-time functionaries and elected officials should be the focus of the research project.</p></section></div><!--TEI back matter --><div class="tei_back"><section class="bibliography" id="index-back.1_div.1"><header><h2><span class="head" itemprop="head">Sources and Literature</span></h2></header><ul class="listBibl"><li><div itemprop="bibl" class="biblfree">Ahbe, Thomas. <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Ostdeutschland und die Ostdeutschen als Erzählung: identitätsstiftende Narrative im Widerstreit</span>.

As a result, the party's roots in eastern Germany have declined significantly since 2006, which is also due to the structural aging of its eastern German members, the majority of whom are over 60.
