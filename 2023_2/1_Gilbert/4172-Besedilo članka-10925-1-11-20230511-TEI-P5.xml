                        of Italy and the UK suggest that European integration is a contested process

                        complex national realities to adapt themselves to norms decided collectively
                        at elite level. In hindsight (but not only in hindsight), the UK’s political
                        culture, and Italy’s political-institutional system, were radically
                        unprepared for the shock of accelerating integration in the 1990s and

                <p style="text-align:justify">The dominant popular and political narrative of
                    European integration is a “progressive” one: it is what the British historian
                    Herbert Butterfield called “Whig” history.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="1"
                        >Herbert Butterfield, <hi rend="italic">The Whig Interpretation of
                            History</hi> (London: Bell, 1931; Pelican, 1973).</note> The building /
                    construction of Europe is seen in teleological terms as a story of the evolution
                    of the European project from the dark excesses of nationalism, which culminated
                    in Fascism, to the unique supranational institutional and political structure
                    that exists today. It is admitted that the “process” (a word that conveys a
                    certain inevitability) was not always smooth. It was obstructed, every step of
                    the way, by the “Tories,” i.e. by the opponents of the project: nationalists,
                    “Eurosceptics,” the Marxist left. Yet the “Whigs” prevailed in the end. The EEC
                    became the EC in gradual steps and the EC gave way to the EU, which was the
                    answer the European Project found to the great challenges posed by the end of
                    the Cold War, the unification of Germany, and the demise of communism.<note
                        place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="2">This is a deliberate oversimplification to
                        make a point. For more detail, see Mark Gilbert, “Narrating the Process:
                        Questioning the Progressive Story of European Integration,” <hi
                            rend="italic">Journal of Common Market Studies</hi> 46, No. 3 (2008):

                <p style="text-align:justify">In my general history of European integration, I tried
                    to tell the story, by contrast, as a one of perfectly comprehensible and
                    legitimate conflicts.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="3">Mark Gilbert, <hi rend="italic"
                            >European Integration: A Political History</hi> (Rowman &amp;
                        Littlefield, 2020, 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> edition).</note> Every
                    stage of the European “construction” has been characterized by disputes and
                    arguments over what to do. This was perfectly normal since the “process” has, at
                    every point, created disruption for domestic political arrangements: to the
                    policies, institutions, and political cultures of the member states. It was not
                    a small matter for France to accept the end of industrial protectionism in the
                    1960s, or for Denmark to choose Europeanization, or for Britain, which possessed
                    a rational agricultural policy until it joined, to accept the “producerist”
                    logic of the CAP. It is entirely normal, not evidence of nationalism, or
                    “Euroscepticism,” that such changes provoked dissent, disagreement, and even
                    outright political turmoil. Indeed, dissent often led to worthwhile outcomes. De
                    Gaulle’s hostility to the Hallstein Commission’s centralizing tendencies, for
                    instance, led directly to the “Luxembourg Compromise” and, ultimately, to the
                    creation of the European Council. I think it can be said with confidence that
                    the “European Project” would never have survived the 1970s and early 1980s
                    without this innovation.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Daniele Pasquinucci has argued in a thoughtful series
                    of articles, and now an important book, that even ardent European federalists –
                    professors in the Italian university, for instance – could rapidly become
                    critical of Europeanization when it touched their privileges and institutional
                        prerogatives.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="4">Daniele Pasquinucci, <hi
                            rend="italic">Il frutto avvelenato: il vincolo europeo e la critica
                            all'Europa</hi> (Milan: Mondadori / Le Monnier, 2022).</note> His
                    scrupulous research on micro-historical case studies underlines the key point
                    that I am making in this first paragraph: European integration is above all
                    political, and politics is (among other things) dissent over what, in any given
                    case, is the right course of action. European integration <hi rend="italic">has
                        from the first generated political controversy</hi>.<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn6" n="5">It is for this reason that the concept of “soft
                        Euroscepticism” is a misnomer. The only “Euroscepticism” worthy of the name
                        is so-called “hard Euroscepticism,” i.e. the hostility on principle to the
                        whole notion of supranational government in Europe displayed by romantic
                        nationalists, illiberal democrats, fascists, and communist nostalgists. To
                        argue that all those who criticize the EU’s policies are “Eurosceptic,”
                        however limited and thoughtful their dissent may be, is deeply undemocratic.
                        As a proud British patriot, I would hate to be called “Anglosceptic” because
                        I do not sympathize with many of the policies that Prime Ministers Boris
                        Johnson and Liz Truss have advanced (or, for that matter, that Prime
                        Minister Keir Starmer will advance). To criticize a given EU policy, to
                        doubt its utility, to argue against an extension of European competences, is
                        not evidence of hostility to the project as a whole, or not necessarily. For
                        “hard” and “soft” Euroscepticism, see the well-known work by Aleks
                        Szczerbiak and Paul Taggart, especially “The Party Politics of
                        Euroscepticism in EU member and Candidate States,” Sussex European
                        Institute, 2003.</note></p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">In the case of the transition from the EC to the EU,
                    which is what we are discussing in this conference, controversy was both
                    inevitable <hi rend="italic">and</hi> justified, or so I would contend. The
                    decision to deepen European integration and to create the EU before widening
                    membership to the former communist states was a bold one. I’m not an expert on
                    the growing literature as to why this decision was taken, but I do know two
                    things: (1) it would not have been taken had there not been a “shift in mood” in
                    the 1980s towards great confidence in the future of the European Project; (2)
                    some of the twelve member states were not remotely ready for it.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The high point of the notion of the inexorability of
                    the European construction comes in the late 1980s. The 1992 Initiative, the
                    Delors’ presidency, and the Franco-German accord following the failure of
                    Mitterrand’s attempt to build socialism in one country, gave the “European
                    Project” renewed vitality. Americans, especially, were struck from 1988 onwards
                    by the emergence of a potential European superpower.<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn7" n="6">This is the topic of my “A Shift in Mood: The 1992
                        Initiative and Changing U.S. Perceptions of the European Community,
                        1988–1989,” in <hi rend="italic">European Integration and the Atlantic
                            Community</hi>, eds. Kiran Klaus Patel and Ken Weisbrode (New York:
                        Cambridge University Press, 2013), 243–64.</note> The late 1980s were a time
                    of extraordinary confidence among European leaders about the prospects of
                    European integration, and about its capacity to resolve problems. They believed,
                    for instance that the crisis of disintegrating Yugoslavia could be resolved, or
                    at any rate, softened by the adoption of the Community method.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">They also reached for the tool of “more Europe” when
                    the continent faced the unexpectedly swift collapse of communism and the
                    reunification of Germany.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">For precisely this reason, I don’t agree with Kiran
                    Patel when he suggests, in his excellent book, <hi rend="italic">Project

                <p style="text-align:justify">Patel relativizes the TEU because he is thinking of it
                    institutionally. Yet he himself also argues (rightly) that historians of
                    contemporary Europe need to study the impact European integration has had on the
                    member states a good deal more than we have so far. The TEU’s impacts were vast
                    (and often positive). In the economic organization of the continent, on the
                    candidate countries, on the domestic politics of the existing member states, the
                    acceleration of the European Project represented by the TEU made a major
                    difference. It was not only a leap in the dark, but a step on a climb that not
                    everybody was ready to undertake, or physically fit enough to attempt.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The impact of the TEU on the political systems of some
                    member states was immediate. The Danes rejected the treaty almost immediately,
                    and France came within 1 percent of doing the same in September 1992. The two
                    countries’ referendums are usually depicted as evidence of widespread
                    “Euroscepticism” among the Danes and the French: actually, what they show is
                    perfectly natural dissent when gigantic political changes are administered “top
                    down” without democratic consultation.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">In both Denmark and France, the TEU (and the follow-up
                    treaties) acted as a catalyst for shifts in the party system. In Denmark, the
                    Danish Peoples’ Party (DPP) was formed in the wake of the TEU and ever since
                    opposition to the EU has been part of its “identitarian” platform. This party
                    has been in eclipse since 2019, not least because more mainstream parties have
                    stolen its anti-immigrant positions, but at its peak it was second party in the
                    elections of June 2015 (21 percent).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9" n="8">For
                        the DPP, see Thorsten Borring Olesen, “Danish Euroscepticism and its

                    In both countries, nationalism increased after the creation of the EU.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Of course, I would not claim that the acceleration of
                    the European Project was the only cause of the emergence of political movements
                    in Western Europe that are right-wing nationalist. It was, however, one reason,
                    and a big one. In the 1990s, a line was crossed in the minds of many voters.
                    Maastricht set in motion a dynamic that was bound to arouse long-term objections
                    towards the European Project as a whole. West Europeans were more conscious of
                    national identity (and the national interest) than Brussels (or academics)
                    realized. When further deepening took place, above all at Lisbon, “hard”
                    Euroscepticism was ignited in several West European countries.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">I want to take this argument further by looking more
                    in depth at two other countries: the United Kingdom and Italy. I would argue
                    that, for different reasons, the democracies of both countries were unprepared
                    for the innovations launched at Maastricht and, as a result, membership of the
                    EU, while it may have been economically beneficial, has fomented nationalism in
                    both countries.</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">From the outset, Britain had been bitterly divided
                    over the question of membership of the EC. The three biggest parliamentary
                    battles, in terms of hours of debate, breakdown of party loyalties among MPs,
                    and public spillover, in contemporary British history are: (1) the Brexit
                    Withdrawal Bill in 2019; (2) the ratification of the TEU; (3) the debate over
                    the European Communities legislation 1971—72.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The principal cause of the division in the UK has
                    always been loss of national sovereignty. This objection on principle to
                    European integration in the 1970s crossed party lines: the original opposition
                    to membership of the EC was carried on by Conservative MPs and intellectuals
                    such as Enoch Powell, but also by many left-wing intellectuals, notably Michael
                    Foot, Tony Benn, and Douglas Jay.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="9">On

                <p style="text-align:justify">These men of principle (there was one prominent woman,
                    Barbara Castle) failed to convince public opinion of depression-hit, declinist
                    Britain that EC membership was a bad thing. In the 1975 referendum, 67 percent
                    voted to stay in, though few were enthusiasts, and even fewer understood the
                    political dimension of the EC Project. It was regarded as a “Common Market.”</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">After Maastricht the EU became a fundamental issue for
                    a considerable part of the Conservative Party. Prime minister John Major only

                <p style="text-align:justify">The TEU ruined Major’s premiership, and after he was
                    defeated by Tony Blair in the 1997 elections, the Conservative Party became
                    partisans in the cause of securing a “better deal” from the EU. All the
                    subsequent leaders of the Conservative Party post-Major: Hague, Duncan-Smith,
                    Howard, Cameron, and May were “Reluctant Europeans,” as, incidentally, was
                    Labour’s Gordon Brown. They supported British membership, but only if Britain’s
                    opt-outs and exemptions remained and were extended. [Johnson, Truss and Sunak

                    the lady herself became an open critic of the EU after long being a supporter of
                    the European Community. (3) The anti-marketeers of the 1970s had been proven
                    right. It is important to recognize this point. The EU had leeched away
                    parliamentary sovereignty, Germany had become <hi rend="italic">primus inter

                    nationalism for many British voters and able demagogues like Nigel Farage and
                    Boris Johnson mobilized voters with other legitimate grievances. Together with
                    the authentic hardcore Eurosceptics there was suddenly a majority against

                <p style="text-align:justify">The crucial transition point was immediately after the
                    TEU. Between 1992 and 1999 the Conservative Party was transformed from being a
                    broadly pro-Europe party into a party that regarded Brussels at best with
                    suspicion and at worst as an enemy of the British people. Since the Conservative
                    Party is the principal party of government in the UK and is the party that took
                    the UK into Europe, this mattered enormously.</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">The case of Italy is in some ways even more
                    interesting. The TEU required Italy’s political class to do something that it
                    was incapable of doing. Namely, if it wanted to be a member of the euro, be like
                    the Germans, or the Dutch. Keep public spending under strict control, implement
                    efficiency improvements to make the economy more competitive, go down to the gym
                    and get on the treadmill. Numerous Italian scholars and policy analysts argued
                    passionately that the “vincolo europeo” would compel Italy’s leaders to reverse
                    the fiscal incontinence of the 1980s and early 1990s when the Italian state ran
                    annual deficits of 10—12 percent of GDP and interest rates on medium-term
                    government debt reached 15 percent. They were wrong.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Except from a strenuous effort under Romano Prodi to
                    meet the Maastricht criteria by 1999, an effort that was rewarded by his

                    Brussels and Berlin that positive things are being done, and then have the rug

                    The national debt inched downwards from 120 percent of GDP at the time of the
                    Maastricht Treaty to just over 100 percent in 2008. Italy never seemed likely to
                    reach the 60 percent figure mandated by the Stability and Growth Pact. The
                    subsequent Euro crisis, which led to higher bond yields on Italian debt, and the
                    need to cope with the costs of Covid, propelled the figure to almost 160
                    percent. Servicing the debt has obliged high taxes, low public investment, and
                    stagnating demand.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Italy could only have eliminated or reduced the debt
                    mountain bequeathed by the 1980s and early 90s by some combination of higher
                    inflation to reduce the debt’s value (impossible with the BCE in the early
                    2000s), by more rapid growth (this required sweeping measures of liberalization
                    that no government was strong enough to implement), by higher and more equitably
                    distributed taxes (politically impossible for all the elected governments since
                    1992) and by the efforts of innovative, hardworking exporters (who fortunately
                    exist in large numbers and have kept the country afloat). The option of
                    devaluation plus temporary austerity to boost competitiveness was taken off the
                    table by euro membership.</p>

                    obscure PSI functionary in Milan was arrested for taking bribes. It was the

                    Berlusconi could invent a party and see it reach 30 percent in the polls in a
                    few days. In 1996, the Lega Nord even promised to invent a new country

                    criteria” was hyper-fragmented. Romano Prodi’s winning Ulivo Coalition (1996—98)
                    contained Social Democrats, Liberal Progressives, Conservatives, Christian
                    Democrats and depended on the external support of Communist Refoundation. His
                    2006—2008 coalition was even more variegated. Berlusconi’s right-wing coalition,
                    the “People of Freedoms,” at various times between 1994 and 2011 contained
                    Liberals, the Lega Nord, the “ex-Fascists,” Christian Democrats of at least
                    three different kinds, and, for a while, the Radicals. Moreover, the Italian
                    constitution, with its strong bicameral parliament, makes passing contentious
                    legislation very difficult.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The EU imposed technocratic government of Mario Monti
                    on Italy in 2011 to prevent the financial markets from turning Italy into
                    Greece. His emergency government was followed by three PD (Partito
                    Democratico)-led governments (Letta—Renzi—Gentiloni, 2013—16) and then in March
                    2018, there was a huge popular rebellion that brought Matteo Salvini’s Lega and
                    the Five Stars Movement (M5S) to power: two populist, vocally anti-EU parties
                    obtained over 50 percent of the vote between them. Salvini salvaged the former
                    Lega Nord from irrelevance and scandal by reinventing it as a nationalist party
                    representing the whole of Italy in a crusade against the euro.<note place="foot"

                        (2017): 624─41.</note> The truth is that Italy’s failure to prosper inside
                    the EU has awoken nationalism, as the election of Giorgia Meloni has
                    demonstrated.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Italian nationalism is much stronger than people
                    realized back in the 1990s, with the important caveat that Italian populists are
                    more pragmatic than non-Italians have generally recognized. Populists in Italy
                    have waved the flag, and condemned the EU’s meddling in Italian affairs, as a
                    way of mobilizing the support of the discontented but have also been much more
                    cautious than British Conservatives once they were in power. The M5S, the most
                    openly anti-EU party in Italy for many years, has reinvented itself as a
                    critical supporter of the EU since 2018; in power, the Lega has become a
                    “reluctant European” party, while Giorgia Meloni regards guarded support for the
                    EU as a way of bringing “Brothers of Italy” into the European mainstream and to
                    earn greater respectability. Italian Euroscepticism may have peaked in 2018. The
                    lure of political power, plus the fact that Italy has become the largest
                    beneficiary of the funds distributed by the EU’s “next generation” recovery plan
                    for Europe, able to spend more than €200 billion by 2026, has softened the
                    Italian parties’ hard Eurosceptic rhetoric. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn17"
                        n="16">For a description of the domestic politics of the adoption of the
                        Recovery Plan, see Erik Jones, ‘Italy and Europe: From Competence to
                        Solidarity to Competence,’ <hi rend="italic">Contemporary Italian
                            Politics</hi> 13, No. 2 (2021): 196–209. There is a rapidly growing
                        literature in Italian on this topic.</note> Whether by accident or design,
                    the EU has bought itself back into Italian hearts.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Despite this caveat, it cannot be disputed that Italy
                    in 1999 was manifestly unfit, politically and institutionally even more than
                    economically, for the huge tasks mandated by membership of the euro. It was not
                    as unfit as Greece, but that is not saying much. To live by the Euro’s rules,
                    one needed to have stable governments capable of making unpopular decisions and
                    getting them through parliament. Since 1992, certainly, but in reality at least
                    since the 1970s, Italy has not had such a system.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">There may have been no alternative. Failure to join
                    the euro in 1999 might have led to a crash of the lira and the implosion of the
                    political system. Europe might have had an Argentina on its doorstep. Sometimes,
                    there are no good choices.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">What the cases of Italy and the UK suggest, however,
                    is that European integration is not an inevitable one and certainly not one that
                    inevitably brings good results. It requires complex national realities to adapt
                    themselves to norms decided collectively at elite level. In hindsight (but not
                    only in hindsight), the UK’s political culture, and Italy’s
                    political-institutional system, were radically unprepared for the shock of
                    accelerating integration in the 1990s and 2000s.</p>

                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p style="text-align:justify">So what am I saying here? Three things. In first
                    place, that European integration has immense potential disruptive effect on
                    political systems and this potential has grown as its ambitions have grown. In
                    second place, dissent and political opposition to the EU is not necessarily
                    Euroscepticism, but may be fear of unknown consequences, or even a rational
                    preference for not fixing something that isn’t broken. In third place, the
                    ambitious deepening of European integration was one of the principal causes of
                    the growth in “hard” Euroscepticism. Nobody should be shocked by this bald
                    statement of fact.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">A further consideration follows, I think, from these
                    conclusions, although there is no space here to do more than state it. This is
                    the importance of writing the negative impacts of “more Europe” into the story
                    of European integration. Euroscepticism, Brexit, and the revival of Italian
                    nationalism, like Gaullism, are an intrinsic <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of the
                    history of European integration, not obstacles to its realization. One of the
                    major problems of the historiography of European integration is that too many of
                    its proponents consider the process of constructing Europe to be both inexorable
                    and invariably benign in its effects. This is not true. It is (and always will
                    be) a contested process, and one whose evolutions have substantial impacts on
                    the democracies of its member states.</p>

                <head>OD EVROPSKE SKUPNOSTI DO EVROPSKE UNIJE. PRIPRAVLJENI ALI NE</head>
                <head>POVZETEK</head>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Pri obravnavi prehoda od Evropske skupnosti k Evropski
                    uniji je pomembno troje. Najprej je treba poudariti, da lahko evropsko
                    združevanje na politične sisteme vpliva zelo razdiralno in da se je ta potencial
                    povečeval z naraščanjem ambicij tega procesa. Drugič, ni nujno, da sta
                    nestrinjanje in politično nasprotovanje EU evroskepticizem, ampak sta lahko
                    strah pred neznanimi posledicami ali celo racionalna odločitev ne popravljati
                    nečesa, kar dobro deluje. Tretjič, ambiciozno poglabljanje evropskega
                    združevanja je bilo med glavnimi vzroki razmaha “trdega” evroskepticizma. Gre za
                    golo dejstvo, ki ne bi smelo nikogar presenetiti.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Čeprav v prispevku ni dovolj prostora za podrobnejšo
                    obravnavo, iz teh sklepov izhaja še en razmislek, in sicer kako pomembno je v
                    zgodbo o evropskem združevanju vključiti negativne učinke prizadevanj za “več
                    Evrope”. Evroskepticizem, brexit in oživitev italijanskega nacionalizma so –
                    tako kot gaullizem – sestavni del zgodovine evropskega združevanja, ne pa ovira
                    za njegovo uresničevanje. Ena glavnih težav zgodovinopisja evropskega
                    združevanja je, da preveč njegovih zagovornikov meni, da je vzpostavljanje
                    Evrope neustavljiv proces z izključno blagodejnimi učinki. To ne drži, saj je
                    (in vedno bo) sporen proces, katerega razvoj bistveno vpliva na demokracije
                    držav članic.</p>
