It is admitted that the “process” (a word that conveys a certain inevitability) was not always smooth. It was obstructed, every step of the way, by the “Tories,” i.e. by the opponents of the project: nationalists, “Eurosceptics,” the Marxist left. Yet the “Whigs” prevailed in the end. The EEC became the EC in gradual steps and the EC gave way to the EU, which was the answer the European Project found to the great challenges posed by the end of the Cold War, the unification of Germany, and the demise of communism.<span id="ftn3_return"><a class="notelink" title="This is a deliberate oversimplification to make a point.

This was perfectly normal since the “process” has, at every point, created disruption for domestic political arrangements: to the policies, institutions, and political cultures of the member states. It was not a small matter for France to accept the end of industrial protectionism in the 1960s, or for Denmark to choose Europeanization, or for Britain, which possessed a rational agricultural policy until it joined, to accept the “producerist” logic of the CAP. It is entirely normal, not evidence of nationalism, or “Euroscepticism,” that such changes provoked dissent, disagreement, and even outright political turmoil. Indeed, dissent often led to worthwhile outcomes. De Gaulle’s hostility to the Hallstein Commission’s centralizing tendencies, for instance, led directly to the “Luxembourg Compromise” and, ultimately, to the creation of the European Council. I think it can be said with confidence that the “European Project” would never have survived the 1970s and early 1980s without this innovation.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e160"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Daniele Pasquinucci has argued in a thoughtful series of articles, and now an important book, that even ardent European federalists – professors in the Italian university, for instance – could rapidly become critical of Europeanization when it touched their privileges and institutional prerogatives.<span id="ftn5_return"><a class="notelink" title="Daniele Pasquinucci, Il frutto avvelenato: il vincolo europeo e la critica all'Europa (Milan: Mondadori / Le Monnier, 2022)." href="#ftn5"><sup>4</sup></a></span> His scrupulous research on micro-historical case studies underlines the key point that I am making in this first paragraph: European integration is above all political, and politics is (among other things) dissent over what, in any given case, is the right course of action.

The decision to deepen European integration and to create the EU before widening membership to the former communist states was a bold one. I’m not an expert on the growing literature as to why this decision was taken, but I do know two things: (1) it would not have been taken had there not been a “shift in mood” in the 1980s towards great confidence in the future of the European Project; (2) some of the twelve member states were not remotely ready for it.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e180"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The high point of the notion of the inexorability of the European construction comes in the late 1980s. The 1992 Initiative, the Delors’ presidency, and the Franco-German accord following the failure of Mitterrand’s attempt to build socialism in one country, gave the “European Project” renewed vitality. Americans, especially, were struck from 1988 onwards by the emergence of a potential European superpower.<span id="ftn7_return"><a class="notelink" title="This is the topic of my “A Shift in Mood: The 1992 Initiative and Changing U.S. Perceptions of the European Community, 1988–1989,” in European Integra…" href="#ftn7"><sup>6</sup></a></span> The late 1980s were a time of extraordinary confidence among European leaders about the prospects of European integration, and about its capacity to resolve problems. They believed, for instance that the crisis of disintegrating Yugoslavia could be resolved, or at any rate, softened by the adoption of the Community method.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e188"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>They also reached for the tool of “more Europe” when the continent faced the unexpectedly swift collapse of communism and the reunification of Germany.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e190"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>For precisely this reason, I don’t agree with Kiran Patel when he suggests, in his excellent book, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Project Europe</span>, that the TEU “is not the absolute watershed it is often said to be.”<span id="ftn8_return"><a class="notelink" title="Kiran Klaus Patel, Project Europe (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2020), 270." href="#ftn8"><sup>7</sup></a></span> Maastricht, I think, was a leap into the dark that had immense consequences.

Yet he himself also argues (rightly) that historians of contemporary Europe need to study the impact European integration has had on the member states a good deal more than we have so far. The TEU’s impacts were vast (and often positive). In the economic organization of the continent, on the candidate countries, on the domestic politics of the existing member states, the acceleration of the European Project represented by the TEU made a major difference. It was not only a leap in the dark, but a step on a climb that not everybody was ready to undertake, or physically fit enough to attempt.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e211"><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>The impact of the TEU on the political systems of some member states was immediate. The Danes rejected the treaty almost immediately, and France came within 1 percent of doing the same in September 1992. The two countries’ referendums are usually depicted as evidence of widespread “Euroscepticism” among the Danes and the French: actually, what they show is perfectly natural dissent when gigantic political changes are administered “top down” without democratic consultation.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e213"><span class="numberParagraph">7</span>In both Denmark and France, the TEU (and the follow-up treaties) acted as a catalyst for shifts in the party system. In Denmark, the Danish Peoples’ Party (DPP) was formed in the wake of the TEU and ever since opposition to the EU has been part of its “identitarian” platform. This party has been in eclipse since 2019, not least because more mainstream parties have stolen its anti-immigrant positions, but at its peak it was second party in the elections of June 2015 (21 percent).<span id="ftn9_return"><a class="notelink" title="For the DPP, see Thorsten Borring Olesen, “Danish Euroscepticism and its Changing Faces / Phases, 1945–2018,” in Euroscepticisms: The Historical Roots…" href="#ftn9"><sup>8</sup></a></span> In France, the Front National was given fresh vigour by its opposition to the TEU. In both countries, nationalism increased after the creation of the EU.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e221"><span class="numberParagraph">8</span>Of course, I would not claim that the acceleration of the European Project was the only cause of the emergence of political movements in Western Europe that are right-wing nationalist. It was, however, one reason, and a big one. In the 1990s, a line was crossed in the minds of many voters. Maastricht set in motion a dynamic that was bound to arouse long-term objections towards the European Project as a whole. West Europeans were more conscious of national identity (and the national interest) than Brussels (or academics) realized. When further deepening took place, above all at Lisbon, “hard” Euroscepticism was ignited in several West European countries.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e223"><span class="numberParagraph">9</span>I want to take this argument further by looking more in depth at two other countries: the United Kingdom and Italy. I would argue that, for different reasons, the democracies of both countries were unprepared for the innovations launched at Maastricht and, as a result, membership of the EU, while it may have been economically beneficial, has fomented nationalism in both countries.</p></section><section class="teidiv0" id="index-body.1_div.3"><header><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head">The United Kingdom </span></h2></header><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e227"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>From the outset, Britain had been bitterly divided over the question of membership of the EC. The three biggest parliamentary battles, in terms of hours of debate, breakdown of party loyalties among MPs, and public spillover, in contemporary British history are: (1) the Brexit Withdrawal Bill in 2019; (2) the ratification of the TEU; (3) the debate over the European Communities legislation 1971—72.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e229"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The principal cause of the division in the UK has always been loss of national sovereignty.

Prime minister John Major only narrowly managed to ratify the TEU in the face of a rebellion by his own backbenchers.

All the subsequent leaders of the Conservative Party post-Major: Hague, Duncan-Smith, Howard, Cameron, and May were “Reluctant Europeans,” as, incidentally, was Labour’s Gordon Brown. They supported British membership, but only if Britain’s opt-outs and exemptions remained and were extended.

Indeed, the lady herself became an open critic of the EU after long being a supporter of the European Community. (3) The anti-marketeers of the 1970s had been proven right.

The TEU required Italy’s political class to do something that it was incapable of doing. Namely, if it wanted to be a member of the euro, be like the Germans, or the Dutch. Keep public spending under strict control, implement efficiency improvements to make the economy more competitive, go down to the gym and get on the treadmill. Numerous Italian scholars and policy analysts argued passionately that the “vincolo europeo” would compel Italy’s leaders to reverse the fiscal incontinence of the 1980s and early 1990s when the Italian state ran annual deficits of 10—12 percent of GDP and interest rates on medium-term government debt reached 15 percent. They were wrong.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e298"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Except from a strenuous effort under Romano Prodi to meet the Maastricht criteria by 1999, an effort that was rewarded by his defenestration from government by the left-wing parties of his coalition<span style="font-weight:bold" itemprop="hi">, </span>no elected Italian government has addressed the need for a better-run state.

Italy never seemed likely to reach the 60 percent figure mandated by the Stability and Growth Pact. The subsequent Euro crisis, which led to higher bond yields on Italian debt, and the need to cope with the costs of Covid, propelled the figure to almost 160 percent. Servicing the debt has obliged high taxes, low public investment, and stagnating demand.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e319"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Italy could only have eliminated or reduced the debt mountain bequeathed by the 1980s and early 90s by some combination of higher inflation to reduce the debt’s value (impossible with the BCE in the early 2000s), by more rapid growth (this required sweeping measures of liberalization that no government was strong enough to implement), by higher and more equitably distributed taxes (politically impossible for all the elected governments since 1992) and by the efforts of innovative, hardworking exporters (who fortunately exist in large numbers and have kept the country afloat).

It was the event that triggered the collapse of the Italian First Republic during the <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">tangentopoli</span> scandal (1992—94). The Italy that ratified the TEU and negotiated the subsequent Amsterdam Treaty was one engaged in rebuilding its political system: one where an entrepreneur like Silvio Berlusconi could invent a party and see it reach 30 percent in the polls in a few days. In 1996, the Lega Nord even promised to invent a new country (“Padania”) and was rewarded with 10 percent of the national vote.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e326"><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>The party system that had to meet the “Maastricht criteria” was hyper-fragmented.

His 2006—2008 coalition was even more variegated. Berlusconi’s right-wing coalition, the “People of Freedoms,” at various times between 1994 and 2011 contained Liberals, the Lega Nord, the “ex-Fascists,” Christian Democrats of at least three different kinds, and, for a while, the Radicals.

His emergency government was followed by three PD (Partito Democratico)-led governments (Letta—Renzi—Gentiloni, 2013—16) and then in March 2018, there was a huge popular rebellion that brought Matteo Salvini’s Lega and the Five Stars Movement (M5S) to power: two populist, vocally anti-EU parties obtained over 50 percent of the vote between them. Salvini salvaged the former Lega Nord from irrelevance and scandal by reinventing it as a nationalist party representing the whole of Italy in a crusade against the euro.<span id="ftn16_return"><a class="notelink" title="Marco Brunazzo and Mark Gilbert, “Insurgents against Brussels: Euroscepticism and the right-wing populist turn of the Lega Nord since 2013,” Journal o…" href="#ftn16"><sup>15</sup></a></span> The truth is that Italy’s failure to prosper inside the EU has awoken nationalism, as the election of Giorgia Meloni has demonstrated.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e336"><span class="numberParagraph">8</span>Italian nationalism is much stronger than people realized back in the 1990s, with the important caveat that Italian populists are more pragmatic than non-Italians have generally recognized. Populists in Italy have waved the flag, and condemned the EU’s meddling in Italian affairs, as a way of mobilizing the support of the discontented but have also been much more cautious than British Conservatives once they were in power. The M5S, the most openly anti-EU party in Italy for many years, has reinvented itself as a critical supporter of the EU since 2018; in power, the Lega has become a “reluctant European” party, while Giorgia Meloni regards guarded support for the EU as a way of bringing “Brothers of Italy” into the European mainstream and to earn greater respectability. Italian Euroscepticism may have peaked in 2018. The lure of political power, plus the fact that Italy has become the largest beneficiary of the funds distributed by the EU’s “next generation” recovery plan for Europe, able to spend more than €200 billion by 2026, has softened the Italian parties’ hard Eurosceptic rhetoric. <span id="ftn17_return"><a class="notelink" title="For a description of the domestic politics of the adoption of the Recovery Plan, see Erik Jones, ‘Italy and Europe: From Competence to Solidarity to C…" href="#ftn17"><sup>16</sup></a></span> Whether by accident or design, the EU has bought itself back into Italian hearts.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e344"><span class="numberParagraph">9</span>Despite this caveat, it cannot be disputed that Italy in 1999 was manifestly unfit, politically and institutionally even more than economically, for the huge tasks mandated by membership of the euro. It was not as unfit as Greece, but that is not saying much. To live by the Euro’s rules, one needed to have stable governments capable of making unpopular decisions and getting them through parliament. Since 1992, certainly, but in reality at least since the 1970s, Italy has not had such a system.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e346"><span class="numberParagraph">10</span>There may have been no alternative. Failure to join the euro in 1999 might have led to a crash of the lira and the implosion of the political system. Europe might have had an Argentina on its doorstep. Sometimes, there are no good choices.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e349"><span class="numberParagraph">11</span>What the cases of Italy and the UK suggest, however, is that European integration is not an inevitable one and certainly not one that inevitably brings good results. It requires complex national realities to adapt themselves to norms decided collectively at elite level. In hindsight (but not only in hindsight), the UK’s political culture, and Italy’s political-institutional system, were radically unprepared for the shock of accelerating integration in the 1990s and 2000s.</p></section><section class="teidiv0" id="index-body.1_div.5"><header><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head">Conclusions</span></h2></header><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e353"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>So what am I saying here? Three things. In first place, that European integration has immense potential disruptive effect on political systems and this potential has grown as its ambitions have grown. In second place, dissent and political opposition to the EU is not necessarily Euroscepticism, but may be fear of unknown consequences, or even a rational preference for not fixing something that isn’t broken. In third place, the ambitious deepening of European integration was one of the principal causes of the growth in “hard” Euroscepticism. Nobody should be shocked by this bald statement of fact.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e355"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>A further consideration follows, I think, from these conclusions, although there is no space here to do more than state it. This is the importance of writing the negative impacts of “more Europe” into the story of European integration. Euroscepticism, Brexit, and the revival of Italian nationalism, like Gaullism, are an intrinsic <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">part</span> of the history of European integration, not obstacles to its realization. One of the major problems of the historiography of European integration is that too many of its proponents consider the process of constructing Europe to be both inexorable and invariably benign in its effects. This is not true. It is (and always will be) a contested process, and one whose evolutions have substantial impacts on the democracies of its member states.</p></section></div><!--TEI back matter --><div class="tei_back"><section class="bibliography" id="index-back.1_div.1"><header><h2><span class="head" itemprop="head">Sources and Literature</span></h2></header><ul class="listBibl"><li><div itemprop="bibl" class="biblfree">Brunazzo, Marco, and Mark Gilbert. “Insurgents against Brussels: Euroscepticism and the right-wing populist turn of the Lega Nord since 2013.” <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Journal of Modern Italian Studies</span> 22 (2017): 624–41.</div></li><li><div itemprop="bibl" class="biblfree">Butterfield, Herbert. <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">The Whig Interpretation of History</span>.

Najprej je treba poudariti, da lahko evropsko združevanje na politične sisteme vpliva zelo razdiralno in da se je ta potencial povečeval z naraščanjem ambicij tega procesa. Drugič, ni nujno, da sta nestrinjanje in politično nasprotovanje EU evroskepticizem, ampak sta lahko strah pred neznanimi posledicami ali celo racionalna odločitev ne popravljati nečesa, kar dobro deluje. Tretjič, ambiciozno poglabljanje evropskega združevanja je bilo med glavnimi vzroki razmaha “trdega” evroskepticizma. Gre za golo dejstvo, ki ne bi smelo nikogar presenetiti.</p><p style="text-align:justify" id="index-p-d46e461"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Čeprav v prispevku ni dovolj prostora za podrobnejšo obravnavo, iz teh sklepov izhaja še en razmislek, in sicer kako pomembno je v zgodbo o evropskem združevanju vključiti negativne učinke prizadevanj za “več Evrope”. Evroskepticizem, brexit in oživitev italijanskega nacionalizma so – tako kot gaullizem – sestavni del zgodovine evropskega združevanja, ne pa ovira za njegovo uresničevanje. Ena glavnih težav zgodovinopisja evropskega združevanja je, da preveč njegovih zagovornikov meni, da je vzpostavljanje Evrope neustavljiv proces z izključno blagodejnimi učinki. To ne drži, saj je (in vedno bo) sporen proces, katerega razvoj bistveno vpliva na demokracije držav članic.</p></section></div><!--Notes in [TEI]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Notes</div><div class="note" id="ftn1"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn1_return"><sup>*</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">C.

The only “Euroscepticism” worthy of the name is so-called “hard Euroscepticism,” i.e. the hostility on principle to the whole notion of supranational government in Europe displayed by romantic nationalists, illiberal democrats, fascists, and communist nostalgists. To argue that all those who criticize the EU’s policies are “Eurosceptic,” however limited and thoughtful their dissent may be, is deeply undemocratic. As a proud British patriot, I would hate to be called “Anglosceptic” because I do not sympathize with many of the policies that Prime Ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss have advanced (or, for that matter, that Prime Minister Keir Starmer will advance). To criticize a given EU policy, to doubt its utility, to argue against an extension of European competences, is not evidence of hostility to the project as a whole, or not necessarily. For “hard” and “soft” Euroscepticism, see the well-known work by Aleks Szczerbiak and Paul Taggart, especially “The Party Politics of Euroscepticism in EU member and Candidate States,” Sussex European Institute, 2003.</span></p></div><div class="note" id="ftn7"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn7_return"><sup>6.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">This is the topic of my “A Shift in Mood: The 1992 Initiative and Changing U.S. Perceptions of the European Community, 1988–1989,” in <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">European Integration and the Atlantic Community</span>, eds.
