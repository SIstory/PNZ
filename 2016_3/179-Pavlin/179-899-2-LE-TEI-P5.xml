                        and then in the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century, sport has become
                        an integral part of the Slovenian national essence and culture. It is true
                        that for a long time the expressions "physical education" and "physical
                        culture" were used as umbrella terms for this social area, while in the
                        organisational sense sport was and remains based on organisation in clubs.
                        In the context of organisation a specific structure had been set up after
                        World War II. At the end of the 1980s the first conceptual and
                        organisational changes were introduced, while with the declaration of the
                        Slovenian independence further changes and entry into the international
                        space were implemented. The following contribution reveals the key moments
                        of pre-independence and the first steps towards the preparation of the
                        independence of sports by means of the Slovenian own Olympic Committee,
                        followed by the declaration of independence in June 1991 and its
                        implications for sport. Then the contribution shortly outlines the dilemmas
                        of sport reorganisation stemming from the political-economic transition and
                        the new relationship between the public and club sport after the
                        independence.</hi></p>

                    can nevertheless safely state that it has seen its true renaissance in the

                    amply shown by the medals from the Olympic and other competitions that do away
                    with the stereotypical image of Slovenians as individual athletes, primarily
                    skiers. Let me just quickly emphasise the qualifications of the Slovenian
                    football team for the European (2000) and World Cup (2002, 2010); or the
                    qualifications of the hockey team for the Olympics in Sochi (2014) and again for
                    the upcoming 2018 Olympics; the silver medal of the handball team at the
                    European Championship in Ljubljana in 2004; the newest silver medal of the
                    volleyball team at the European Championship in 2015; and the fourth place of
                    the basketball team at the 2009 World Championship. The individual achievements
                    of clubs at the European club level are also a part of these successes. It is a
                    fact that sports were – and still are – a well-developed and popular part of the
                    leisure time of Slovenians, whether competitive or recreational. According to
                    the assessments more than half of the Slovenian population of various ages and
                    genders supposedly regularly or periodically engage in sports, meaning that
                    Slovenia is ranked quite high also in the European scope. The green landscape
                    and cities which can compensate for the lack of infrastructure as well as the
                    "enthusiasm" and zeal that influences the recreational, amateur, voluntary or
                    professional activities has, in the past, connected sports with the national
                    question and national identity. This also opens the question of acknowledging
                    and evaluating the influence of sports on the formation of the national
                    awareness and statehood, as budgetary financing in the middle of the 1990s was
                    at the tail end of Europe, while on the other hand Slovenian athletes were,
                    paradoxically, directly proportional in their competitive achievements. How can
                    we explain this, especially in light of the fact that financing within the
                    sports budget increased for unorganised or public sports, and why?
                    Transition?</p>
                <p> Slovenian sport has a long tradition and continuity, if we look at its
                    organisational foundations and structure. Already in 1862 an initiative to
                    establish a "gymnastic" society in Ljubljana was undertaken in the enthusiastic
                    atmosphere of restoring the constitutional life in what was then the Austrian
                    Empire. Thus the Južni Sokol organisation was established in October 1863. In
                    view of its name, which refers to a similar Sokol organisation from Prague,
                    literature often tends to stereotypically reiterate that this organisation was
                    modelled after the Czech one. Admittedly it is true that among the Habsburg
                    Slavs the first Sokol organisation was founded in Prague in February 1862 and
                    that the Czechs represented a cultural model for Slovenians in the period until
                    World War I. However, it is also a fact that gymnastic activities had been
                    well-known in Ljubljana already before 1862, and that the citizens of Ljubljana
                    engaged in sports independently or also unaware of the developments in Prague.
                    Furthermore, it was nothing new for the people of Ljubljana to organise
                    themselves in societies. As it happened, the first societies had already been
                    established during the "Spring of Nations", while a year before the
                    aforementioned gymnastic initiative the so-called Čitalnica society had been
                    established, which had brought together athletic enthusiasts as well. Athletes
                    came together in their own society, similar to the Čitalnica society. They
                    contacted the northern Czech 'brothers' and named their organisation Južni Sokol
                    (Southern Sokol) in light of the contemporaneous Pan-Slavism, while their expert
                    knowledge was based on the inventiveness of the people of Ljubljana.<note

                        34.</note> The gymnastic society was an indicator of the physical culture
                    life of Slovenians, which had already developed before World War I when cycling,
                    mountaineering as well as sports that spread especially in the interwar period
                    had already been organised in a similar way as gymnastics. Thus physical culture
                    became a distinctive activity of Slovenians, in the organisational sense – in
                    view of the common Yugoslav state after World War I – integrated in the Yugoslav
                    state organisations and consequently into international sports. Similarly as
                    after the turning point in the years 1918 and 1919, in 1990 and 1991 athletes
                    had to face a question of how to proceed, but this time enriched by the
                    tradition as well as their international distinctiveness. </p>

                <head>The Pre-independence Period</head>
                <p>The story of the emancipation of sports includes, on the one hand, the political
                    process in the second half of the 1980s and the Yugoslav dissolution as well as
                    the simultaneous question of whether – or how – the political radicalisation was
                    reflected in sports. On the other hand we have to take into account the
                    attainment of independence, dissolution of Yugoslavia, and international
                    recognition and integration. When studying the events in the 1980s we should
                    also look at, firstly, the state sport organisation and the developments in the
                    state sport associations, and, secondly, for example, the competitions in the
                    leagues where the national and political confrontation was reflected in fandom
                    and incidents. Thus, for example, the Olimpija ice hockey team from Ljubljana
                    was already in the season 1985/86 – after the match against Crvena zvezda from
                    Belgrade in the completely full Tivoli Hall in Ljubljana – punished with a
                    one-month ban on playing in the home Tivoli Hall due to a "nationalist" cheering
                    incident. Meanwhile, elsewhere in Yugoslavia the nationalist cheering incidents
                    culminated especially at the football derbies, particularly with the conflict
                    between the fans of Dinamo from Zagreb and Crvena zvezda from Belgrade in Zagreb
                    in 1990, which represented a sinister precursor to the subsequent military
                    conflicts. </p>
                <p>In light of the Slovenian international sport integration, focus was especially
                    aimed at the establishment of the Slovenian Olympic Committee and its
                    recognition as well as at the club and competitive part of the sport. However,
                    this also included the integration of the sport administrative bodies in the
                    European institutions, which coincided with the political changes and
                    transformation of the republic's administrative system and bodies. In view of
                    the political and economic change from socialism to market economy and
                    democracy, the time after the Slovenian emancipation opened the issues or
                    transition of the (socialist) "socially-owned" to the public and private. In
                    sports, the transition of the 1990s was reflected in the organisational,
                    administrative, budgetary, ownership (e.g. ownership of gymnastic facilities and
                    other sport infrastructure), legislative (the Sports Act of 1998), and, after
                    all, also in the terminological sense. In certain sports segments the transition
                    had started already before 25 June 1991, e.g. organisationally also after 1989,
                    in line with the political changes in the Republic of Slovenia and the
                    transformation of the republic administrative bodies and budget. We should also
                    emphasise the terminological "sportisation" in 1990, as for decades in the
                    socialist Yugoslavia the umbrella term had been <hi rend="italic">physical
                        culture</hi> ("telesna kultura" in Slovenian and "fizička kultura" in the
                    other republics), and this had included the subsystems of <hi rend="italic"
                        >physical education, recreation</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sport.</hi> Sport
                    was the common term for recreational, amateur and professional competitive
                    organisations and activities. Officially only the football players in the
                    premier federal league were professionals, while otherwise the competitive
                    systems were based on amateurism, even though various forms of professionalism
                    were also quietly introduced in the other sports in the 1970s and 1980s. In this
                    sense it is possible to note the shortage of historical analyses of the Yugoslav
                    period, especially the so-called "Portorož decisions", adopted in the middle of
                    the 1970s, which represented a sort of a transition of the contemporaneous
                    system of sports. These decisions coincided with the constitutional changes and
                    the introduction of self-management communities of interest, through which the
                    financing of the sports activities was implemented while the expert questions
                    were solved in the sports organisations. In terms of organisation, club sport
                    was, at the level of the republic, covered by the Association of Physical
                    Culture Organisations of Slovenia (hereinafter ZTKOS), which brought together
                    the interests of autonomous sports associations, the Partizan<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn4" n="3"> In 1952, the gymnastic association as a successor to
                        the Sokol organisation was named Partizan (freedom fighter in World War II).
                        In 1963 the Gymnastic Association, focused primarily on sport gymnastics,
                        separated itself from the Partizan association; while the latter focused on
                        general exercise and recreation.</note> of Slovenia association and the
                    Alpine Association of Slovenia. The organisation at the municipal level was
                    similar. The republic associations came together in the central Association of
                    Physical Culture Organisations of Yugoslavia (popularly referred to as the
                    "sofka" – from the Serbo-Croatian name "Savez organizacija fizičke kulture
                    Jugoslavije"). The Yugoslav Olympic Committee – a member of the International
                    Olympic Committee that replaced the older prewar Yugoslav Olympic Board in 1947
                    and was not further divided into republic Olympic Committees but was a single
                    central organisation – functioned in cooperation with the "sofka" association or
                    even within its framework. Therefore Slovenians did not have their own national
                    Olympic organisation in this period. The special committee for top-level sport,
                    managed by a Slovenian, Tomislav (a.k.a. Tomo) Levovnik at the end of the 1980s,
                    also functioned in the framework of the "sofka" association. Similarly as the
                    Associations of Physical Culture Organisations, the republic associations of
                    individual sports were brought together in the Yugoslav sports associations; and
                    the latter were members of the international associations. Therefore
                    international recognition and enrolment into the international associations
                    meant access to international competitions, and for this the membership in state
                    organisations was of key importance. </p>
                <p>If we take another look at the terminology, which also today often results in
                    problems with understanding the system and subsystems or the purpose and
                    assessment of the whole activity: in 1990 – after several discussions,
                    especially academic at the Faculty of Physical Culture (today the Faculty of
                    Sport) – the term <hi rend="italic">physical culture</hi> was changed to <hi
                        rend="italic">sport</hi>. This also involved the renaming of the subsystems:
                        <hi rend="italic">physical education → sport education, recreation → sport
                        recreation, sport → (high-level, top-level) sport</hi>. At the same time <hi
                        rend="italic">sport</hi> was also a hypernym, which is a process that we
                    cannot register in the other republics. In accordance with the above, on 5
                    September 1990 the ZTKOS (Association of Physical Culture Organisations of
                    Slovenia) was renamed as the Sports Association of Slovenia (hereinafter ŠZS).
                    However, in accordance with the democratisation the question of membership was
                    also raised, and the Partizan of Slovenia association, for example, continued
                    its independent path. In 1993 the Partizan of Slovenia association renamed
                    itself as the Sports Union of Slovenia.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="4">

                    of the League of Communists and later its successor, and a comparison should be
                    made between the sorts of sport elections through a longer time frame. After its
                    election assembly in 1991, the ŠZS analysed the current situation with the aim
                    of "seeking the organisational forms and focus of work".<note place="foot"

                    either a twofold organisation and separate sport and Olympic organisation or a
                    single sport-Olympic organisation. At that time Slovenian sport was still quite
                    closely connected to the Yugoslav sport. In February 1991, the further
                    preparations and financing of the top-level athletes in the context of the
                    Olympic cycle Albertville-Barcelona 1992 were discussed at the joint meeting of
                    the "sofka" association and the Yugoslav Olympic Committee. Among other things
                    it was underlined that the political developments in the state should not
                    influence the joint participation of Yugoslav athletes at important
                    international competitions. At the same time this meant that the concept of
                    preparations was also all-Yugoslav, and that this was supposed to ensure
                    "optimum" preparations for all Yugoslav athletes, as there was only another year
                    left to the Winter Olympics. In the context of the preparations, the Yugoslav
                    athletes were also to appear in 1991at the Mediterranean Games (Athens) and the
                    Universiade / World Student Games (Sheffield). However, despite the increasing
                    political tensions the issue of the unresolved system of financing the Olympic
                    candidates was still the "central problem", which had been apparent ever since
                    the first year of the Olympic cycle and only kept getting worse.<note

                    them to register their candidates for the authority bodies. After the attainment
                    of the Slovenian independence this Committee paved the way for the establishment

                <p>With the declaration of the Slovenian independence on 25 June 1991, the process
                    of separation from the Yugoslav associations in the field of sport began, but
                    was prolonged by the Brioni Moratorium. On 26 June the aggression of the
                    Yugoslav Army followed. At the time of the army attack quite a few Slovenian
                    athletes were in the ranks of the Yugoslav teams abroad (the Mediterranean Games
                    in Athens, the European Basketball Championship in Rome, the World Cup in kayak
                    and canoe in Mezzano). Other athletes were at home during the summer
                    competitions or preparing for the competition season. For example, in the autumn
                    hockey players would compete in the newly-organised Alpine League, an
                    international league of the best Italian, Austrian and Slovenian clubs; while
                    skiers, as usual, would compete in the World Cup and in a little over half a
                    year at the Winter Olympics in Albertville. Already on 27 June the ŠZS released
                    a "recommendation" that all sports competitions in the territory of the Republic
                    of Slovenia be postponed, and advised the Slovenian athletes not to participate
                    at the competitions outside of Slovenia due to security reasons.<note

                        place="foot" xml:id="ftn17" n="16"> E. B., "Naša odločitev ni mogla biti
                        drugačna".</note> The (Yugoslav) team leadership tried to persuade them to
                    stay and, according to Debevec, tried to "make them realise that the situation
                    is nevertheless not as dire as to call for such an ... extreme step. Naturally,
                    they (the leadership – author's note) only listened to radio Belgrade, while we
                    have nevertheless read foreign newspapers and called home, and therefore we were
                    better and more objectively informed." Bojan Levstik from Celje, otherwise the
                    trainer of the Italian handball team, was of great help to them, because while
                    the leadership claimed that "there aren't any connections with the homeland, or
                    they are at least very difficult to establish", "Bojan's phone worked perfectly,
                    even for collect calls to Ljubljana. Without this the situation would have been
                    even much more difficult". Rajmond Debevec first explained his decision to leave
                    to the member of the leadership Tomić, also the secretary of the shooting
                    association. He connected Tomić with Levovnik using Levstik's phone, and only
                    then Tomić "believed that this was really happening at home." As Debevec stated
                    after his return to Slovenia, the majority of the leadership respected the
                    decision of the Slovenian athletes not to compete. However, some of the leaders
                    were upset and offended, and they threatened that these athletes' fate – in so
                    far as Yugoslav team competitions were concerned – was "sealed, and that even if
                    the situation calms down and the relations are settled, they will never again be
                    allowed to compete in the federal selection". However, the trainers opposed such
                    extreme notions as well.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="17"> Ibid.</note>
                    Similarly, Jure Zdovc left the European Basketball Championship in Rome, while
                    Yugoslavia later played in the finals and won the European Championship.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of July 1991 a cease fire, negotiations, and the moratorium on
                    secession agreed to in the Brioni Declaration followed. Slovenian athletes found
                    themselves in a difficult position. The Yugoslav state was the holder of the
                    international sport membership in the international sport as well as the
                    participant of international sports competitions, while the 1992 Olympics were
                    also imminent. In the politically strenuous position, on 10 July 1991 the Expert
                    Council of the ŠZS convened a joint meeting with the Council of Top-Level
                    Athletes about the normalisation of the sport activities in the given situation.
                    After the meeting the Expert Council of the ŠZS published an "appeal to
                    Slovenian athletes" to remain active and emphasised "that in the time of the
                    finalisation of the status of the Republic of Slovenia, competing for the
                    Yugoslav state teams and in the federal championships remains completely
                    legitimate and irreproachable", as "even a short interruption of training and
                    maintenance of the sport regime (...) can result in a significant as well as
                    long-term decline in athletic capability".<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn19"

                    resumed its path towards independence and international recognition. In October
                    the ŠZS convened an extended session and, among other things, appealed to the
                    sport organisations to initiate a "separation"<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn20"

                    the Yugoslav sport associations and initiate the proceedings for the membership
                    in the international sport organisations. In this context, for example the
                    recognition in November 1991 by one of the main associations of the Winter
                    Olympics – i.e. the International Ski Federation (FIS), where Janez Kocijančič
                    was a member of the Presidency – was very significant. </p>
                <p> The proceedings of the national Olympic organisation and international
                    membership was led by the Initiative Committee. The Olympic Committee of
                    Slovenia (hereinafter OKS) was established on 15 October 1991 with the signing
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Slovenian Olympic Document</hi>, and Janez Kocijančič
                    was elected as its President at the founding general meeting in the middle of
                    December. The Olympic Document was signed by 29 national sport associations of
                    the Olympic programme, 5 associations recognised by the International Olympic
                    Committee, and two winners of Olympic gold medals – Leon Štukelj and Miroslav
                    Cerar. Simultaneously the Initiative Committee pursued the international
                    recognition and the independent appearance of Slovenian athletes at the 1992
                    Olympics. It managed to negotiate a meeting in the middle of November with the
                    President of the International Olympic Committee (hereinafter IOC) Juan A.
                    Samaranch, at the seat of the IOC in Lausanne. At this important meeting the
                    conditions for the independent participation in Alberville were agreed upon,
                    which was related to the international political recognition of the Republic of
                    Slovenia. According to the memories of a participant of this meeting Rajko
                    Šugman, the "complicated international circumstances, especially in the former
                    Soviet Union and Croatia ... demanded that the Initiative Committee be very
                    careful with regard to the contents of the negotiations". It was agreed that the
                    members of the delegation would inform Samaranch of the situation and explain
                    why Slovenians would not compete under the Yugoslav flag, and they would let the
                    President of the IOC decide. Šugman emphasises that the delegation was aware
                    that this could also be a "double-edged sword", as Samaranch could propose that
                    the Slovenian athletes compete "with the Yugoslav athletes under the inscription
                    Olympic Committee of Yugoslavia" or even under the Olympic flag.<note

                </p>
                <p>The meeting with Samaranch "behind closed doors" at the seat of the IOC took
                    place on 18 November 1991. After the introductory diplomatic part the discussion
                    resumed and in the end it was concluded that Slovenia would be able to compete
                    at the Olympic Games, should it be recognised as a state by at least a few
                    important countries. Three countries were specified: Germany, Spain and France.
                    Samaranch advised the delegation to immediately file a request for recognition,
                    so that he would able to refer to it at the sessions of the Executive Committee
                    of the IOC in December 1991, while on 7 December a joint session would take
                    place with the representatives of the winter sport disciplines – of which the
                    FIS had already recognised the Ski Association of Slovenia.<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn22" n="21"> Ibid., 99, 100.</note> On 28 November the Initiative
                    Committee, now already in the name of the OKS, and the undersigned Miroslav
                    Cerar sent a request to Samaranch in Lausanne for the recognition and attendance
                    at the Olympic competitions. The request emphasised that the OKS was the
                    "representative body of all Olympic sports in the Republic of Slovenia", while
                    the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia no longer existed, as "several
                    sovereign states came into existence and at the time being, between the two most
                    populated nations a most cruel and bloody war is being fought. … Today the
                    Republic of Slovenia maintains its status as an independent and sovereign state.
                    It has its own undisputed territory, a homogenous population and its
                    democratically elected multi-party government. The last soldier of the former
                    Federal Army left Slovenia one month ago. Slovenia has its own currency and own
                    passports, recognized already by twenty foreign states." In the following points
                    the current and historical nation-building role of sport was emphasised, also
                    that "during the Second World War the sporting organisations were among the
                    founders of the National Liberation Front, successfully initiating and leading
                    the campaign of liberation from the foreign occupation." The presence of
                    Slovenians at the Olympic Games ever since Rudolf Cvetko in 1912 was underlined,
                    and finally it was stated that "all associations of Olympic sports and sports
                    recognized by IOC, signed the Slovenian Olympic Charter on 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> October 1991"
                    and declared "their recognition of the Olympic spirit and the recognition of
                    their obedience to the International Olympic Committee in the field of
                    international sport."<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn23" n="22"> Dopis predsedniku

                <p>At the end of 1991 and in the beginning of 1992 the Republic of Slovenia gained
                    recognition, critical for its attendance of the Olympics, and on 17 January 1992
                    it received the IOC's invitation to the Olympic Games.<note place="foot"

                    national flag for the first time in history at the parade of nations in the
                    Albertville's Olympic Arena. Half a year later Barcelona followed, and there the
                    rowers won the first medals – bronze – for the independent Slovenia. However,
                    apart from the Olympic recognition the enrolment into the international sport
                    associations also took place, and this completed the Slovenian international
                    sport recognition.</p>

                <p>1991 was undoubtedly "the historical year" for the Slovenian sport, as the report
                    of the Presidency of the ŠZS emphasises for the period between 1990 and 1994. In
                    the organisational sense it is perhaps comparable with the events at the end of
                    World War I, with the first Slovenian sport and territorial organisation,
                    Yugoslav organisation, and entry into the international sport, as the
                    Austro-Hungarian position had been quite specific. As far as the organisation of
                    civil sport – especially of both the umbrella institutions, the OKS and the ŠZS
                    – is concerned, 1994 is the turning point. At that time these organisations
                    merged under the name Slovenian Olympic Committee - Association of Sports
                    federations. The discussions in favour of and against the merging had been going
                    on ever since 1992, and a similar situation was also notable at the European
                    level. </p>
                <p>However, while describing the events during the emancipation of the Slovenian
                    sport we should also bring the attention to a parallel process: the transition
                    of the previous municipial sports associations into public bodies or organising
                    of new public sport bodies and the expansion of the public sphere at the state
                    and municipal level. This later gave rise to criticism with regard to the
                    nationalisation of sport, or – as Šugman underlined in his study <hi
                        rend="italic">Modeli športa v svetu in podržavljanje športa (Models of Sport
                        Abroad and the Nationalisation of Sport)</hi> (1999) – with regard to the
                    "domination of the state over the civil sphere of sport", which was allegedly
                    "one of the most repulsive forms of the state intervening in this sphere".
                    Already in 1990 the tasks of the former self-management communities of interest
                    were transferred to the republic or municipal bodies. The Republic
                    Administration Act of 20 June 1991 reassigned sport in the previous physical
                    culture sense to the newly-established Ministry of Education and Sport, Sport
                    Division (today Sport Directorate). In 1992 the Ministry formed the Council of
                    Experts for Sport as a consultative body for the preparation of opinions,
                    evaluations, and practical implementation of various proposed measures. Soon the
                    process of preparing the Sport Act was underway. It was sent to the first
                    reading in 1995 and was rather severely criticised, especially because the
                    authors of the Act, according to opposition, did not take the civil sphere into
                    account, even though quite a few discussions and consultations had been
                    organised. The journalist as well as sport professional Oto Giacomelli, who
                    wrote for the <hi rend="italic">Delo</hi> newspaper, was a stern critic and, for
                    example, on 27 May 1996 he underlined that the state had established a "primate
                    over sport" while only assigning a marginal role to the sphere of civil sport.
                    The reproaches were aimed at the Ministry of Education and Sport and the
                    Secretary of Sport at the time, Dr Janko Strel, but indirectly also at the
                    Olympic Committee and its President, as "at the session of the Executive
                    Committee of the OKS, which took place only a day before the first reading of
                    the proposed Sport Act in the Parliament, we could hear significantly more
                    reconciliatory words about the relations between the Olympic Committee and the
                    administrative body for sport as just a few weeks earlier."<note place="foot"

                    basis of the above we have to ask ourselves about the division of authority
                    between the public and private/civil sport sphere, which calls for a dedicated
                    study, especially because the materials of the Slovenian Olympic Committee &amp;
                    Sports Association have been preserved. Admittedly these materials are currently
                    still in disarray, but this is negligible in view of the fact that in sport we
                    far too often face a neglectful attitude to documentation and heritage as well
                    as a shortage of primary sources. </p>
                <p>A new hot topic in the second half of the 1990s was the Ownership Transformation
                    of the Lottery of Slovenia Act and the establishment of the foundation for the
                    financing of sport organisations. According to, for example, the writing of Oto
                    Giacomelli, this was "another slap in the face of sport" (he was referring to
                    the club sport in the context of the Slovenian Olympic Committee – Association
                    of Sports Federations), as the proposed Act would supposedly "marginalise" the
                    role of the club sport and thus also the majority of the "related Slovenian
                    associations of individual sports and all the local (municipal) sport
                        associations".<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn26" n="25"> Oto Giacomelli, "Še

                    that not all sport organisations were members of the Slovenian Olympic Committee
                    – Association of Sports Federations. </p>
                <p>In order to ensure a fuller picture of the state of sport we should also focus on
                    the events according to the individual sport disciplines. In many disciplines
                    the problems were financial and administrative-organisational in nature. A few
                    clubs even went in the red and then went bankrupt, and already in the 1990s
                    ideas started forming about the club ownership according to, for example, the
                    model of football clubs in Great Britain. The search for competition models was
                    also pressing, especially in the collective sports, based either on the
                    Slovenian space (football, handball) or on the integration at the
                    Alpine-Panonian (hockey, volleyball) or former Yugoslav space (basketball). The
                    competition models kept changing and they still are, like for example the most
                    recent changes in handball. The situation in the individual sports was a bit
                    different. </p>
                <p>However, the situation in the recreational and "public" sport remained on par
                    with the competitive sport, which was most exposed in the media. The former was
                    carried out especially through the programmes or projects of the Institute for
                    Sport, established by the state in 1994. We have already mentioned the field of
                    recreation in the introduction, and scientifically this field has been monitored
                    with the studies about the sport and recreational activities of Slovenians (the
                    last study was carried out in 2009 and the first ones already in the 1980s). The
                    studies attested to a quite stable continuity in the field of exercise, and, as
                    far as certain activities are concerned, changes have been registered, e.g. the
                    increase in recreational football in the independent Slovenia.<note place="foot"

                <p>In conclusion let us emphasise another aspect of changes which we only mentioned
                    already above. These took place at the municipal level, where the positive or
                    negative changes were frequently the result of the political or mayor's will,
                    which is clearly obvious from the example of the town of Domžale.<note

                        Municipality between 1991 and 2011] (diploma paper, Ljubljana, 2015).</note>
                    The municipal changes shared the general principle of transforming the social
                    into public-private, but with specific local characteristics. In certain
                    municipalities the municipal Associations of Physical Culture Organisations or
                    Sport Associations could be transformed into public bodies or institutions or
                    municipal departments or even remained operational and faced the competition in
                    the form of municipal agencies, like it happened in Ljubljana, for example.
                    However, we also have to pay attention to the time of changes, influenced also,
                    for example, by the Sport Act, which, among other things, provided for the
                    regularisation of the ownership of sports facilities, which were mostly taken
                    over by the municipalities. The gymnastic halls and athletic grounds of the
                    Partizan societies and the Partizan Slovenije association, which transformed
                    into the Sports Union of Slovenia in 1993, were an exception. Their ownership
                    transformation was accompanied by the stereotype about sport tycoons, which,
                    however, has its own history and would call for a more extensive text. The story
                    of the property of gymnastic societies is related to the time after 1945, when
                    the property of the Sokol organisation and the Catholic gymnastic societies was
                    transferred to the Physical Culture Association of Slovenia in accordance with
                    the "act on transferring the property of physical education societies to the
                    Association of Physical Culture Societies". In accordance with the
                    reorganisations of physical culture after 1948, in 1952 the former property of
                    gymnastic societies was transferred to the Partizan Slovenije, and similarly
                    other sport facilities were taken over by the Sports Association, mountaineering
                    facilities by the Alpine Association, and so on. As the Partizan association
                    established later, this step was urgent, as in the beginning of the 1950s –
                    simultaneously with the nationalisation policy – municipalities started showing
                    appetites for cooperatives and commercial organisations with the aim of
                    appropriating the right to manage the property of gymnastic societies, claiming
                    that it was socially-owned. With the transition after 1991, similar appetites
                    were thwarted by the Sports Union of Slovenia, as this action blocked the
                    aspirations of certain local societies to take over the property. </p>

                <head>POVZETEK</head>
                <docAuthor>Tomaž Pavlin</docAuthor>
                <p>Slovenski šport je bil v jugoslovanski državi v republiškem merilu
                    organizacijsko-strokovno osredotočen v Zvezi telesnokulturnih organizacij
                    Slovenije, na drugi strani pa tesno vpet v jugoslovanskega in preko njega v
                    mednarodni, saj so bile jugoslovanske zveze nosilke mednarodnih nastopov.
                    Septembra 1990 se je Zveza telesnokulturnih organizacij Slovenije preimenovala v
                    Športno zvezo Slovenije (ŠZS) in pripravljala reorganizacijo z ustanovitvijo
                    nacionalnega olimpijskega telesa. Krovni izraz za to področje je bil vse do leta
                    1990 <hi rend="italic">telesna kultura</hi>, nakar se je zgodila (terminološka)
                    tranzicija v <hi rend="italic">šport</hi>. S političnim zaostrovanjem so tudi v
                    ŠZS razpravljali o nadaljnji športni poti in aprila 1991 je ŠZS obvestila
                    jugoslovansko centralno zvezo o reorganiziranju z olimpijskim odborom, vendar v
                    jugoslovanskem okviru. Z agresijo Jugoslovanske armade po razglasitvi
                    samostojnosti junija 1991 je ŠZS pozvala slovenske športnike, da zapustijo
                    jugoslovanske reprezentance, po zaključku brionskega moratorija pa je pozvala
                    športne organizacije k razdružitvi z jugoslovanskimi zvezami in da sprožijo
                    postopke priznanja v mednarodnih športnih zvezah; pri tem je bilo pomenljivo
                    mednarodno smučarsko priznanje novembra 1991. V primeru olimpijskega priznanja
                    je ključno delo odigral Iniciativni odbor za ustanovitev nacionalnega
                    olimpijskega telesa, ki se je novembra 1991 sestal tudi s predsednikom
                    Mednarodnega olimpijskega komiteja J.A. Samaranchom, doma pa oktobra pripravil
                    ustanovitev Olimpijskega komiteja Slovenije (OKS). Po mednarodnem priznavanju
                    slovenske države konec leta 1991 in v začetku leta 1992 je OKS dobil povabilo na
                    olimpijske igre v letu 1992.</p>
                <p>Kot je v letu 1994 poudarilo poročilo predsedstva ŠZS, je bilo leto 1991 nedvomno
                    »zgodovinsko leto« slovenskega športa, vendar pa je vzporedno skladno s
                    politično-ekonomsko tranzicijo potekal tudi proces vezan na tranzicijo
                    družbenega v javno-zasebno. Naloge bivših (socialističnih) samoupravnih
                    interesnih skupnosti so bile že v letu 1990 prenesene na republiške ali občinske
                    organe, zakon o republiški upravi junija 1991 pa je šport prenesel na novo
                    oblikovano Ministrstvo za šolstvo in šport, Sektor za šport (danes direktorat).
                    V devetdesetih letih je nastopilo tudi vprašanje Zakona o športu s polemikami o
                    podržavljanju športa in delitvijo oblasti v športu med javno in zasebno/civilno
                    sfero, medtem ko so športne panoge iskale in vzpostavljale tekmovalne modele in
                    se soočale s prvimi finančnimi težavami. Prispevek se osredotoča na pomembne
                    korake športne osamosvojitve, športno reorganiziranje in snovanje nacionalnega
                    olimpijskega komiteja, junijsko osamosvojitev 1991 in odmev v športu, nato pa
                    nakaže dileme športne tranzicije.</p>
