After his introductory assessment that ever since the beginning people have not trusted politicians and political parties, he focuses on the question of how people have acted throughout this time, how the political institutions have been developing, and how they have been adapting to the world and the times which have changed radically in the last twenty five years. First the author presents numerous dilemmas and methodological peculiarities of the issue at hand (the problem of historical distance, the sensibility of the activity, the uncontrollable and specific sources), and then he proceeds to describe the possible approaches and methods of meeting this challenge. In the second part of the contribution the author sums up the findings resulting from his own research of this period (about the polarisation, personalisation, medialisation and informalisation of politics), placing them into the wider European context. Furthermore, he also outlines the challenges for future research.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span><span style="font-style:italic">Keywords: Political history, 1991–2016, Slovenia, political parties</span></p></div><!--TEI body--><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">"A New Political Spectrum Is Being Created..."</span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Attempting to write a paper about the development of the Slovenian politics of the last quarter of a century represents a special challenge and a kind of an adventure for historians. It is best illustrated by looking at the beginnings and the final stages of the period – namely, extreme points help historiography to correctly place and interpret the processes. Let us begin in 1993 and take a look at the young National Assembly (Slovenian Parliament). That autumn it was visited, in the middle of an intense budgetary discussion, by the Czech President Václav Havel, "Citizen Havel". The former dissident, dramatist and author of political essays addressed the Slovenian MPs with a short speech in accordance with his political thought about the "anti-political politics".<span id="ftn2_return"><a class="notelink" title="Jiří Suk, &#34;Od nezmožnosti politiky k politice jako umění možného.

"A new political spectrum is emerging, with new political subjects who are seeking their own identity and their place. These subjects are now searching for new avenues for cooperation, also with regard to the ways of representation. To put it simply, we are building a political system... However, many dangers lurk in this dramatic, interesting and exciting situation, and we should pay special attention to them. In my opinion, one of such dangers is that the parties in our territory could obtain an overrated role. It seems as if the state suddenly belonged to the political parties. As if the parties were not supposed to serve their country, but rather that the country should serve the parties... I wholeheartedly wish that your Parliament as well as ours were safe from these dangers, which have been preying on us in this difficult period."<span id="ftn3_return"><a class="notelink" title="Dokumentacijsko-knjižnični oddelek Državnega zbora Republike Slovenije, Dobesedni zapis 13. seje I. mandata DZ z dne 9. 11. 1993 [Verbatim Record of 1…" href="#ftn3"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>As the most recent research of our Czech colleagues emphasises, in Havel’s opinion the Czech Parliament was "not safe" from danger. As President, Havel constantly criticised it for being hesitant and slow. Havel’s attitude was quite openly anti-parliamentary (which has until now been overlooked by those who have studied his work), and this stance of his was widely supported by the Czech people.<span id="ftn4_return"><a class="notelink" title="Adéla Gjuričová, &#34;Anti-politics and anti-parliamentarism.

Already in the time when the Slovenian political system was being formed – when there was a lot of optimism in the country – people did not trust the political institutions, parties and politicians.<span id="ftn5_return"><a class="notelink" title="Niko Toš, ed., Vrednote v prehodu VIII.

The events started in the socially sensitive environment: in the city of Maribor, from where the spark of the "people's uprisings" also spread to other cities, including Ljubljana, where protesters would frequently gather in front of the Parliament en masse. Mottoes about the wrongfulness of the political system as well as appeals for the introduction of direct democracy started appearing... Politics once again became similar to the oldest trade, and this was expressed by one of the protesters in a brutally direct, vulgar, but politically exceedingly meaningful banner: "A fuck or a refund!"</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>The beginning and the end of "our period" are thus, at the first glance, quite closely connected in terms of the issue at hand. The cause-and-effect relationship looks like this: a quarter of a century ago we started building a political system, but ever since the beginning we have been finding that it did not work very well and that it should not be trusted. Towards the end of our period we have shown this through protests. The interpretation is simple, but lacking a vital part: <span style="font-style:italic">politics itself.</span> What have the actions of the politicians been, how have the political institutions developed, and how have they adapted to the world and the times that have changed in the last twenty years? Obviously completely differently from what the people expected. Does this mean that politicians are irrational? Are the voters, who keep electing supposedly unsuitable politicians all the time, those who are irrational? How can we explain and describe politics in the modern world? Vaclav Havel once said: "We live in a postmodern world where everything is possible and nothing is certain."<span id="ftn9_return"><a class="notelink" title="Quoted after: Andreas Rödder, 21.0.

Despite many similarities with the political history of the older periods, delving into the more recent past is a true adventure, which at the very beginning poses a few important methodological questions, brings on challenges, reveals dilemmas, but at the same time already offers some answers in advance.</p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">About the Distinctiveness of the Topic and About the Dilemmas</span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The first answer, which can often be noted in the media and in a part of the expert public, is that the research of the Slovenian politics after 1991 may be an interesting and relevant topic, but that nothing truly new can be written about it – at least not anything that has not already been written by those who wrote about it and deliberated on it as it was happening.<span id="ftn11_return"><a class="notelink" title="When the biography of the former President Milan Kučan was published, a journalist of the Delo newspaper brought the attention to this issue as well w…" href="#ftn11"><sup>10</sup></a></span> This sort of history would therefore only make sense if the researcher stumbled upon reliable documents about one of the unknown or unexplained political scandals from the last quarter of the century.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Another preliminary answer, which is actually already a dilemma, concerns the question of the general sensibility of researching processes that have not yet come to their conclusion or we at least do not know that they have concluded. As it is, a quarter of a century of the Slovenian state is a period of a multi-layered transition, which is not yet complete in all of its aspects and surges (of course, it is questionable how to define the conclusions of processes). At the same time this period has been co-created by the elites that are still at least partly publicly active (and which, of course, interpret these processes in their own way). Hence it is supposedly too soon for historians to take a look at this period of time. Things which may seem very significant today and which the historians might focus on in their research could look completely insignificant in time (and vice versa).<span id="ftn12_return"><a class="notelink" title="Rödder, 21.0. Eine kurze Geschichte der Gegenwart, 13." href="#ftn12"><sup>11</sup></a></span> The history of the present, as George Kennan referred to it, is thus allegedly not truly possible.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>The following dilemma, which is simultaneously a challenge, is related to the temporal component. What is a methodologically suitable manner at all in which historians could explore the recent politics and the phenomenon of the political? As it happens, the available materials are inexhaustible in all aspects, with regard to quantity as well as in terms of substantive and scientific breadth. Besides the enormous quantities of materials produced by the media – from newspapers to television, radio and internet sites – it is also possible to collect the oral sources from the participants of the political developments and make use of the vast quantity of the materials produced on a daily basis and published by the state or its institutions (reports on the work of the governments, handover files, studies, legislative materials, verbatim records of parliamentary sessions, etc.). On the one hand these materials are more diverse as, for example, the materials from the period of the first Yugoslav state (Kingdom of SHS/Yugoslavia), but simultaneously also more extensive and more comprehensive (non-evaluated, unfiltered, preserved in their totality). Especially the audio-visual materials, which influence the world view of the today's generations most significantly, represent a special challenge and make the century-old historiographic rule <span style="font-style:italic">Quod non est in actis non est in mundo</span> quite problematic.<span id="ftn13_return"><a class="notelink" title="To find out more about the challenges that the audiovisual media represent for the researchers of the present see: Thomas Lindenberger, &#34;Vergangenes H…" href="#ftn13"><sup>12</sup></a></span> Furthermore, a truly vast quantity of online and other digital contents is being produced today: tweets, Facebook posts, text messages... Quite a few resounding public stories have been triggered precisely by this sort of media, but nevertheless nobody archives these sorts of contents systematically.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>At the same time the historians of the most contemporary period have numerous studies and analyses at their disposal as well as rough data produced by other sciences that focus on modernity. In order to research the period of the independent Republic of Slovenia it is critical to acquire the materials and analyses from the Social Science Data Archives<span id="ftn14_return"><a class="notelink" title="See: O Arhivu družboslovnih podatkov, http://www.adp.fdv.uni-lj.si/o_arhivu/." href="#ftn14"><sup>13</sup></a></span> – especially the surveys produced in the context of the Slovenian Public Opinion research (these have been carried out continuously ever since the 1960s), studies of the political analysis centre, and other studies from the field of politology, sociology, and social sciences. Political economy researchers have the materials of economic institutes at their disposal, while almost all sciences contribute their viewpoint with regard to, for example, research policy.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>The (un)manageable amount of materials on the one hand is closely connected with its research usefulness on the other hand. Naturally, all kinds of materials are useful for researchers. It is only a question of what the researchers focus on and how. However, the materials for the most recent period are largely permeated by the prejudice that they only represent the surface of the events – in accordance with the aforementioned answer or conviction that we already know everything about "our" period, and what we do not know has been concealed and will remain hidden. (Of course, I do not know according to what logic it will then be revealed to our descendants.)</p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">On the Approaches to the Topic and About the Dilemmas</span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Quite a few challenges and dilemmas undoubtedly exist; we only have to ask ourselves how to deal with them. The first dilemma (or rather a preconception) for the researchers who claim that nothing new can be written about this period of time is actually the easiest to handle. We can look at it from a purely philosophical and theoretical as well as from the practical point of view. Namely, when we undertake any serious and methodologically sound research we cannot theoretically know what sort of interpretative conclusions we will reach. Any evaluation in advance can turn out as erroneous (for example, years ago I myself was convinced that from its very beginning King Alexander's Dictatorship in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1930s kept generating new political problems instead of solving them, but later I kept discovering more and more that initially its image as well as its perception were completely different). </p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>In the same vein the questions that we asked yesterday were perhaps completely different and non-essential in comparison with the issues that we are interested in today. Not long ago it was important which politician used to be a member of the League of Communists, while today we are already interested in other things. After all, this kind of questioning represents the essence and the general characteristic of historiography, which concerns all the historic periods. The present and the environment we live in always dictate the research questions. For example, in Germany the 2008 financial crisis resulted in a notably increased interest in the economic history in general.<span id="ftn15_return"><a class="notelink" title="Frank Bösch and Jürgen Danyel, &#34;Die Zeitgeschichtsforschung und ihre Methoden,&#34; in: Zeitgeschichte – Konzepte und Methoden, ed. Frank Bösch and Jürgen…" href="#ftn15"><sup>14</sup></a></span> Simultaneously it is completely practical to claim that research in historiography, which does not lead to any new or original interpretations, is neither meaningless nor flawed. In a sense this is just another way of accumulating knowledge and bringing the attention to the topics and aspects of the historiographic science. However, in so far as research is integral and synthetically-oriented, it is especially meaningful and well-founded – after all, historiography is oriented towards writing complete interpretations.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Another dilemma – that the contemporary time is too young for historians, because historical distance is required for serious research – is justified up to a point. It is certainly simpler to research a remote and concluded process, unlike the today's seemingly chaotic times. Things are easier to interpret if we see them whole, including their beginning and end. However, the advantage represented by distance hides quite a dangerous inherent trap: the knowledge of the end. If we are familiar with the conclusion of a certain process, we are in danger of adapting the whole interpretation of the developments to this ending. We are in danger of looking for reasons in the actions of people, logical in view of the familiar ending (consequence), while forgetting that in history things happen even when nobody is planning them.<span id="ftn16_return"><a class="notelink" title="The historian of ideas and concepts Quentin Skinner refers to this mistake as the myth of prolepsis. One of the researchers of the process of the diss…" href="#ftn16"><sup>15</sup></a></span> The historians focusing on the present do not know the end, and therefore the relationship between the purpose and the supposed result cannot compromise their analyses.<span id="ftn17_return"><a class="notelink" title="The German historian Andreas Wirsching, author of the book about the history of Europe in our time, also states that the advantage of researching the …" href="#ftn17"><sup>16</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>On the other hand, however, we should be aware that the history of the present can have rather direct effects on the formation of the self-image of the state and its citizens, as it studies a recent period and thus addresses the memories of the living or their direct descendants. The history of the present explains "our time", which is why people do care how it is described (this is not only an issue with the history of the present, but rather with all of contemporary history – perhaps in Slovenia this especially concerns the World War II historians). Historiography can contribute to the formation of a "suitable" self-image, just like it happened in Germany after World War II when the myth about the so-called "Erfolgsgeschichte" formed, as well as in Great Britain, where this period was for a long time characterised as the "post-war consensus".<span id="ftn18_return"><a class="notelink" title="The British historiography has characterised the post-war &#34;consensus&#34; as a myth. – Gabriele Metzler, &#34;Zeitgeschichte: Begriff – Disziplin – Problem, V…" href="#ftn18"><sup>17</sup></a></span> Addressing living contemporaries can therefore represent a specific trap for historians, but it is still much more manageable than what is probably the biggest research problem: the amount and variety of materials.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>If only a few decades ago historians kept finding that the history of the most recent period was not possible since the thirty-year restriction on the access to materials was enforced, as a matter of principle, in all the archives, today the situation is quite the opposite. The ocean of sources is endless, and, moreover, these sources are <span style="font-style:italic">different</span> in many aspects from, for example, the sources for studying the history of the First Yugoslavia. In both cases we can outline the developments in politics on the basis of newspaper articles; in both cases we can resort to documents that have been preserved (it seems interesting that historians do not have either the complete archives of the pre-war political parties nor the archives of the today's parties at their disposal);<span id="ftn19_return"><a class="notelink" title="Currently only the materials of three parties – the socialists, the Greens and the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia – are in the Archives of the Republic…" href="#ftn19"><sup>18</sup></a></span> and in both cases we can also make use of political memoirs<span id="ftn20_return"><a class="notelink" title="Quite a few memorial records by the politicians of our period exist, but they focus either on the time of the Slovenian emancipation or represent mere…" href="#ftn20"><sup>19</sup></a></span> and verbatim records of parliamentary sessions. However, here the similarities end. Of course, it is questionable to what a degree the dissimilarity of sources hinders the political historians in their research. In principle this should not represent an obstacle, but it is certainly a kind of a challenge. First we have to be aware that every period has its own sources with their own particular characteristics. The materials about the Theresian reforms of the 18<sup>th</sup> century are certainly different from those about the history of the Communist Party after 1945, and these again differ from the materials about the contemporaneous politics. Today the world is different and individuals operate and work in accordance with other guidelines. In the past a large amount of meeting-minutes was available, and the archives also frequently contained personal notes, letters, and so on. Today these materials are virtually non-existent and unavailable for historians; but we do have television, the internet, living participants of the events, etc. These sources appear less reliable than archival documents, at least at the first glance, even though they can be much more telling. This is especially true of the oral sources – witnesses, once upon a time seen as the "enemies of historians",<span id="ftn21_return"><a class="notelink" title="The collocation was coined by Wolfgang Kraushaar when he problematised the German historiography about the 1968 movement. – Metzler, &#34;Zeitgeschichte: …" href="#ftn21"><sup>20</sup></a></span> can also enrich the available historiographic material considerably, if only we gather and methodologically process their testimonies in a suitable manner.<span id="ftn22_return"><a class="notelink" title="See: Zdenko Čepič et al., Prikrita modra mreža.

As it is, research into modernity focuses more and more on the topics and problems, while the distinctions between the individual disciplines are being blurred.<span id="ftn23_return"><a class="notelink" title="Metzler, &#34;Zeitgeschichte: Begriff – Disziplin – Problem.&#34;" href="#ftn23"><sup>22</sup></a></span> Thus nowadays politologists, lawyers, linguists, anthropologists and historians cooperate (or have done so) in practice.<span id="ftn24_return"><a class="notelink" title="See Conference Program: Parliaments and Methodology.

The situation is similar as it used to be.

Therefore I would just like to underline one more issue that I have faced myself, closely connected with the sheer amount of the materials and density of the political developments. In so far as a researcher's ambition is to comprehensively describe a certain political period at least to a certain degree, the massive amount of the materials at the initial stages dictates a <span style="font-style:italic">descriptive</span> approach. Thus the wish to control and encompass <span style="font-style:italic">everything</span> in itself impedes any methodological creativity.<span id="ftn25_return"><a class="notelink" title="Bösch and Danyel, &#34;Die Zeitgeschichtsforschung und ihre Methoden,&#34; 9–10." href="#ftn25"><sup>24</sup></a></span> However, if researchers only have a limited amount of materials at their disposal, they are forced to resort to different approaches and can at the same time be more daring in the thesis they propose.</p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">Topic Presentation</span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Regardless of all the dilemmas and methodological challenges I will now take the first step into the adventure and give a short description of the political history of the independent Slovenia, on the basis of which it will be possible to ask new questions and open new research dilemmas.

Numerous transitional characteristics could be seen in the campaign. It was something new and it did not only shake up political life, but society in general, it drew the attention of many citizens and included many scandalous stories, happily gloated over by journalists and citizens alike.

Once the relationships between coalition and opposition were established, the Parliament and the Government began addressing its vast agenda.

In addition to fundamental legislative activities, the common thread of the first National Assembly term was economic issues. Throughout the term, Drnovšek's coalition gradually dissolved, with only the LDS and SKD (Slovenian Christian Democrats<span class="apple-converted-space">) </span>remaining in the end.<span id="ftn29_return"><a class="notelink" title="Gašparič, Državni zbor 1992–2012, 53–70." href="#ftn29"><sup>28</sup></a></span></p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.2"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.2. </span><span class="head">The weakness of the great coalition (the 1996–2000 term)</span></h3><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>After elections, the second convocation of the National Assembly found itself in a stalemate position. The parties of the so-called transition right wing (new parties, formed in the late 1980s and early 1990s) aggregately received 45 votes and all others (mainly parties, based on former socialist organisations), including the two members representing minorities and supporting the actual Prime Minister Drnovšek (the president of LDS, the party that was the relative winner in the elections), also received 45 votes. The Parliament, a reflection of the society, found itself in a predicament, divided equally in half ... The constitutive session dragged on and on and opposing views were in evidence at each parliamentary step. However, the politicians finally managed to reach an agreement resulting in a large coalition between the largest parties, LDS and SLS (Slovene People’s Party), joined by DeSUS.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The coalition that was finally formed after a difficult few months was very diverse despite the small number of partners because LDS and SLS represented a combination of two conceptually and socially completely different parties. In practice, during the second term, this thesis was confirmed by parliamentary practice to a large extent. Conditions and realities in the National Assembly were often confusing; it seemed that SLS was more of an opposition party than a coalition party. Furthermore, the opposition failed to attack and control the government in a coordinated manner because it was also divided itself on an ideological level. SDS and SKD were closer to SLS and ZLSD was closer to Liberal Democratic Party. The dissolution of the coalition often seemed inevitable. In November 1997, presidential elections for a five-year term were once again held. Despite some reservations, Milan Kučan ran again and won the election in a landslide (for the last time).</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Despite all of its crises (which were quite frequent, especially those related to personnel), the shaky coalition between LDS and SLS managed to keep going until the eve of the end of its term. In the spring of 2000, only six months before elections, the coalition-opposition relationships in the Parliaments were blown apart. After many difficult meetings with ups and downs, the related parties, SLS and SKD, finally managed to agree on merging into one party that would not be a part of the coalition. The fall of the "falling" government was impending. Drnovšek did not wait for things to develop further; he was a step ahead of his partners and proposed the replacement of SLS ministers with new ones. A vote of confidence was connected with the replacement of ministers, but it was not passed. After merging, SLS and SKD became the largest party in Parliament and shortly after the demise of Drnovšek it proposed Andrej Bajuk as the new Prime Minister. However, the new parliamentary coalition was not destined to last for long, as the second term was about to end in less than six months. Also, the coalition itself experienced a severe political crisis after only a month.<span id="ftn30_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., 71–91." href="#ftn30"><sup>29</sup></a></span></p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.3"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.3. </span><span class="head">Leftist domination (the 2000–2004 term)</span></h3><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>On Sunday, 15 October 2000, the third National Assembly elections took place in Slovenia. Once again, there was an election campaign and many appearances took place, mainly by well-known parties and faces ... The elections that occurred at the turn of the decade, century, and millennium did not represent a major milestone themselves, but they symbolically marked the entry into a new era. The first decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, named the "Time of Freedom" by the British historian Timothy Garton Ash, was coming to an end and a new "nameless decade" was beginning; this was an elusive period without clear features.<span id="ftn31_return"><a class="notelink" title="Timothy Garton Ash, Jahrhundertwende.

The following year, on 5 October 2000, only ten days prior to elections in Slovenia, the last Yugoslav tyrant was overthrown – the Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević. All of this may seem like some historical censorship of an epoch. Slovenia was a part of these global currents and during its third National Assembly term also joined the European Union and NATO, symbolically (maybe even in an illusory manner) concluding the transition process in the country. On top of everything, the third term was also the last term led by Drnovšek's great LDS, the strongest party after 1992. The election results on 15 October 2000 were its swansong. LDS received 36.21% votes, assuring it 34 seats in the Parliament. It formed a coalition with ZLSD, SLS and DeSUS.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>To a large extent, the third term and the forms of parliamentary work were characterised by the weakness of the opposition, the core of which were SDS (former SDSS, renamed in Slovenian Democratic Party) and NSi (new party named New Slovenia). The coalition was soon nicknamed "voting steamroller" and in such conditions the opposition had to remain firm. During the term, in 2002, the government had a new Prime Minister (Tone Rop) following Janez Drnovšek's election to President of the Republic.<span id="ftn32_return"><a class="notelink" title="Gašparič, Državni zbor 1992–2012, 92–107." href="#ftn32"><sup>31</sup></a></span></p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.4"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.4. </span><span class="head">Rightist domination (the 2004–2008 term)</span></h3><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>On the one hand, the fourth National Assembly elections, which were called by the President of the Republic to take place on 3 October 2004, gave the impression of an entirely every-day democratic routine with a standard election campaign, and yet on the other they continued to be stuck in established ideological and political patterns. The "cultural fight" between the "left wing" and the "right wing" continued, though its intensity decreased. The election results were not entirely unexpected, but they marked a major ideological turning point. The great LDS lost for the first time after 1992. On that Sunday, the winner was SDS with its leader Janez Janša, who gradually became the flag bearer of the opposition after 1996. Janša then also formed a coalition and became the Prime Minister. If the distinct supremacy of the coalition and the weakness of the opposition marked the third term, one could conclude that the fourth term would be completely different in this regard. The coalition was smaller, more diverse, and two hard-bitten parties in the opposition preyed on it, not allowing the Government to even have the traditional 100 days of peace. Different conditions and practices in Parliament were to be expected. However, no significant changes occurred and the initial (unrealistic) expectations crumpled. At the beginning, the stability and support of the coalition and the Government were high (also in public opinion), but on the hand, the opposition succumbed to internal searching and splits. In particular, LDS seemed to have been experiencing a crisis. Therefore, the fourth term was similar to the third term, only a few roles changed. European topics were the undeniable cohesive element of politics and numerous other topics were divisive along the traditional left-right axis. During this time, in 2007, new presidential elections were held, but Janez Drnovšek did not run again due to illness. The winner was Danilo Türk.<span id="ftn33_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., 108–23." href="#ftn33"><sup>32</sup></a></span></p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.5"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.5. </span><span class="head">In the shadow of the crisis (the 2008–2011 term)</span></h3><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>On the eve of the fifth National Assembly elections in September 2008, the Slovene political arena seemed quite clear and predictable. The common thread of all parties was "welfare", but the plans in their programmes to achieve welfare were increasingly less specific and noticeably increasingly more alike. Contrary to expectations, the relative victory went to the party SD (Social Democrats) formerly known as ZLSD whose leader, Borut Pahor, became the Prime Minister.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>On the eve of the elections, it was already clear that a debt and financial crisis is spreading around the world and that it might grow into a wider economic crisis affecting Slovenia as well. Pahor's team gave the impression that it was aware of the situation, but in the following few months, it acted slowly and indecisively as per the Prime Minister's consensual approach. The first bundle of anti-crisis measures reached the Parliament at the end of the year. It was adopted by Members of Parliament on their last sitting in 2008, thus symbolically foreshadowing the main focus of the fifth term – overcoming the crisis which finally grew from a financial crisis into a political one.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Throughout the term, there was division on all important topics (or at least those that were stressed as such). When the Government finally managed to agree on a solution for the border issue with the neighbouring Croatia, which must undoubtedly be counted as one of its major successes, it immediately encountered firm objections from the opposition and a portion of prominent intellectuals (however, a large portion of intellectuals in the public eye supported the agreement). During the third year of the term, the trust in the Government and the Parliament was still low and dissatisfaction grew. The political arena remained implacable and the coalition was increasingly giving the impression that it was blocked from the outside and from within and that it did not have any real "exit" ideas. The path into a political crisis was thus set. The coalition gradually dissolved, ultimately consisting only of SD and LDS. </p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>The fifth term ended by a vote of no confidence given to the Government and, with no new candidate for a Prime Minister, the President dissolved the National Assembly on 21 October 2011. For the first time in (nearly) twenty years of the Slovenian Parliament, early elections were to take place, planned for 4 December 2011. The trust in a significant portion of parliamentary parties was shaken and a significant restructuring of the political arena was to be expected.<span id="ftn34_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., 124–43." href="#ftn34"><sup>33</sup></a></span></p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.6"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.6. </span><span class="head">The time of disappointment and weariness (the 2011–2014 term)</span></h3><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Between the President's announcement that he would dissolve the National Assembly and the elections, there was not much time. In such circumstances, it was not surprising that the campaign lacked truly innovative approaches, convincing and insightful solutions and compelling addresses to the voters. The elections were quite peaceful (but not without scandals) and, for the first time in twenty years, divisive ideological topics were more evidently pushed into the background. In early October, the political atmosphere was still predictable. However, shortly afterwards, the political arena began to change drastically as new political faces and new parties appeared one after another. Less than two months prior to elections, two new parties with an extremely high rating appeared, as they climbed to the top of election polls. The first one was founded by the Mayor or Ljubljana, Zoran Jankovič (PS -Pozitivna Slovenija - Positive Slovenia), and the second by the former minister Gregor Virant (Državljanska lista Gregorja Viranta - Gregor Virant’s Civic List).</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>If the campaign warned of major political shifts in Slovenia, the election results on Sunday, 4 December 2011, only confirmed them. The election was won by Jankovič's PS, but its president – again, for the first time in twenty years – did not become Prime Minister. The coalition was formed by Janez Janša, the leader of SDS, which received the second highest number of votes. The Parliament and the Government began fervently working and dealing with the crisis and the fiscal consolidation of the country.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>The dissatisfaction of people due to the economic crisis gradually increased in the second half of 2012 and was directed specifically at political elites. Numerous "people's uprisings" erupted. In such circumstances, the coalition collapsed and in March 2013 a new Slovenian Government was formed under the leadership of Alenka Bratušek of PS (first woman Prime Minister). After the new Government was elected, the political storm calmed down for one year despite numerous troubles in the Cabinet and unsuccessful staff choices, until Bratušek resigned. This automatically ended the term for the entire Cabinet. No one proposed a new political figure to form a government and the new President, Borut Pahor, elected in 2012, dissolved the Parliament on 2 June and called for elections to be held on 13 July 2014 (with harsh criticism due to the summer holiday period).<span id="ftn35_return"><a class="notelink" title="Gašparič, Slovenski parlament, 81–96." href="#ftn35"><sup>34</sup></a></span></p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.7"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.7. </span><span class="head">The 2014– term</span></h3><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>It was expected that the elections would, as in 2011, significantly change the political and personnel structure of the Parliament. There were several reasons for this. Following the demise of Janša's Government, the momentum of people's uprisings began to decline. However, the dissatisfaction with politics and political elites remained and the results of public opinion polls continued to be unforgiving. Therefore, a few uprising groups, such as the All-Slovene People's Uprising, decided to use the potential of the uprisings to actively enter into politics. In December 2013, the party Solidarnost (Solidarity) was formed. The next year, on 1 March 2014, the party United Left (<span style="font-style:italic">Združena levica</span>) was formed following the example of the then still attractive and convincing Syriza in Greece. Just prior to the elections, additional three parties entered the political arena: the party Verjamem (<span style="font-style:italic">I Believe</span>) led by Igor Šoltes, Alliance of Alenka Bratušek, and the Party of Miro Cerar. The latter (later renamed into the Modern Centre Party) ultimately won with the largest percentage of votes after 1992 and subsequently formed the current Slovenian Government together with SD and DeSUS.<span id="ftn36_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid." href="#ftn36"><sup>35</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The political situation has calmed down and it seems that politics has retreated to the background somewhat... </p></div></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.5"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">Findings and Challenges</span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>What conclusions can we draw on the basis of this short insight in the political history of the last quarter of a century? Firstly, the introductory finding that out period is very <span style="font-style:italic">dynamic</span>, riddled with events and <span style="font-style:italic">"unreadable"</span> can certainly be confirmed. Despite the relative political stability of the Slovenian governments (in comparison with the Czech Republic, for example), the party space has been unstable and ever changing, in a continuous state of restructuring. Its most notable constant was the <span style="font-style:italic">polarisation</span> – the division of the political actors into the Slovenian left and right. Furthermore, certain characteristics already noted in the broader European space can also be ascribed to the Slovenian development: the <span style="font-style:italic">personalisation</span> of politics, <span style="font-style:italic">medialisation</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic">informalisation</span>.<span id="ftn37_return"><a class="notelink" title="Wirsching, Der Preis der Freiheit, 308–18." href="#ftn37"><sup>36</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Let us first look at the phenomenon of the left-right <span style="font-style:italic">polarisation.</span> Where does it originate from and what is its perception based on? At list partly the dividing line was (and still is) the attitude of the political parties to the past, especially to World War II and the post-war socialist period. In this regard certain parties see Yugoslavia and its society in an exceedingly binary manner. Their interpretative pattern is totalitarian‑historical, reducing the past merely to good and evil.<span id="ftn38_return"><a class="notelink" title="See: Michal Pullmann, Konec experimentu. Přestavba a pád komunismu v Československu (Praha: Scriptorium, 2011), 15–16." href="#ftn38"><sup>37</sup></a></span> The adherents of this pattern only look at this state in order to find arguments for and against their views. According to them an "evil" regime reigned in Yugoslavia, which was an "artificial creation" that repressed the good of the society. Some of them may acknowledge, though, that Yugoslavia also had some advantages. Such a generalised claim is disputable already in the very analytical sense, since it presupposes that people were nothing but indoctrinated masses, incapable of taking care of themselves and simply persisting quietly in the Yugoslav framework. However, as soon as these masses became capable of thought, they immediately wanted to break free of the Titoist chains and seek safe haven in their own democratic national states. This pattern is clearly understandable and politically useful, but it overlooks the actual disposition of the people.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>The attitude towards the past can be associated with the issues of <span style="font-style:italic">continuity and discontinuity</span> in the historical development. Despite the various convictions of individual political parties, in the development after 1990 and 1991 we can notice many elements of continuity from the previous period as well as radical turning points and transformations, which is characteristic for the whole of the eastern Central Europe.<span id="ftn39_return"><a class="notelink" title="Gašparič, &#34;O samoumevnosti uvajanja parlamentarne demokracije v vzhodni Evropi.&#34;" href="#ftn39"><sup>38</sup></a></span> We can also discern that the parties with their emphasised interest in history and their opinions about it frequently introduce additional confusion into the political space or contribute to the mythisation of the past. There are ample examples: for instance, in the last twenty-five years two parties from opposing sides appealed to the heritage of the social democratic party from Austria, established in 1896. The president of the Slovenian People's Party stated that he was extremely proud to be the successor of Anton Korošec, the most eminent Slovenian politician in the First Yugoslavia, even though the today's Slovenian People's Party has nothing to do with Korošec (except fictitiously).<span id="ftn40_return"><a class="notelink" title="Cf. Mateja Ratej, &#34;Začetki politične pluralizacije v pojugoslovanski Sloveniji. Vprašanje političnega nasledstva Koroščeve SLS,&#34; Zgodovinski časopis 6…" href="#ftn40"><sup>39</sup></a></span> Later another party referred to Korošec's party as well...</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>The <span style="font-style:italic">personalisation</span> of politics is another characteristic of the Slovenian politics as well as of the European politics of our time. This may be nothing new, as we have known many examples of outstanding political personae in the post-war Europe (e.g. Charles de Gaulle, Willy Brandt). However, these were always personifications of concrete contents and standpoints. On the other hand, after 1990 we find that in Europe political personalities <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> have come to the forefront, frequently without any contents (they have even been known to form their parties in an ad hoc manner).<span id="ftn41_return"><a class="notelink" title="Wirsching, Der Preis der Freiheit, 313–15." href="#ftn41"><sup>40</sup></a></span> Slovenia is no exception in this regard. It seems that few parties are resilient enough to survive the replacement of their main leaders, whom all the spotlights are aimed at, without significant turmoil.<span id="ftn42_return"><a class="notelink" title="On the other hand, the pre-election events in the neighbouring Croatia in the summer of 2016 attest to the fact that the replacement of an unpopular p…" href="#ftn42"><sup>41</sup></a></span> The latter phenomenon is certainly closely connected with the <span style="font-style:italic">medialisation</span> of politics, which is also a wider all-European characteristic.<span id="ftn43_return"><a class="notelink" title="Wirsching, Der Preis der Freiheit, 312." href="#ftn43"><sup>42</sup></a></span> While jumbo posters were a great novelty of the campaigns back in 1992, the political actions of today are taking place on a variety of media platforms. The Parliament may still be the central arena for political debates, but other formats represent an increasingly serious competition. Furthermore it seems that the Parliament in its essence is mostly and merely the following: the arena for debates and not the space where politics is being formed. In the people's opinion, serious political decisions are reached far away from the public gaze, which means that politics is <span style="font-style:italic">informalised.</span> This is also nothing new: we have already underlined that even in the old Yugoslavia and old Austria people were frequently convinced that politics is being made behind closed doors, often in the absence of the Parliament (the only difference is that once upon a time the cabinets and coffee houses were filled with smoke, which is probably a thing of the past). However, back then the frustrated Members of Parliament finally gave vent to their irritation by engaging in severe obstructions. In our period, however, deputies are simply overburdened with their functions in the working bodies and other activities, which may consequently diminish the importance of the Parliament.<span id="ftn44_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., 311." href="#ftn44"><sup>43</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>In light of these findings it seems that the connection between the introductory Havel's warning and the large-scale anti-political demonstrations is more understandable. Nobody (or almost nobody) wanted to undermine the trust in the parliamentary democracy intentionally. That simply happened due to the aforementioned characteristics of politics. There is no cause-and-effect relationship; and this, on the other hand, gives rise to other questions, partially focused on the future. One of the first questions is whether we have arrived to the end of the big and deeply-rooted parties with their traditional electoral bases. This does not seem impossible. In 2005 a large-scale public opinion research was carried out among the voters in the Western European countries, who responded that political parties were necessary, but also rejected the thesis that the existent parties were truly concerned with the welfare of the people.<span id="ftn45_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., 347." href="#ftn45"><sup>44</sup></a></span> So what is the alternative, then? In parliamentary democracy the alternative can only be another political party, but in the future such a party will have to be very different from those established a quarter of a century ago. The detailed exploration of party-political dynamics is thus certainly one of the research challenges – not only external dynamics, but possibly also the dynamics within the parties themselves, in so far as the researchers are enabled to analyse that. Shedding some light on the party dynamics will finally allow us to gain a better insight in the <span style="font-style:italic">decision-making process.</span> The aforementioned collaboration of anthropologists, linguists, politologists and historians should be ensured, since the issue is multi-layered and the answers are not necessarily rational.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>As it is, politics is not a game of chess, as the German historian Gerhard A.

Prvi odgovor, ki ga je pogosto zaslediti v medijih in delu strokovne javnosti, je ta, da je raziskovanje slovenske politike po letu 1991 že zanimiva in relevantna tema, a o njej ni mogoče napisati ničesar zares novega, vsaj nič takega, kar ne bi sprotni kronisti dogajanja že zapisali. Drugi vnaprejšnji odgovor, ki je pravzaprav že dilema, zadeva vprašanje obče smiselnosti raziskovanja procesov, ki še niso zaključeni. Čas naj bi bil za pogled zgodovinarja še premlad. S časovno komponento je povezano naslednja dilema. Kako sploh metodološko ustrezno kot zgodovinar raziskovati nedavno politiko in fenomen političnega? Gradivo, ki je na voljo, je namreč brezbrežno v vseh ozirih – tako po količini kot po problemski in znanstveni širini.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Izzivov in dilem je nedvomno precej, vprašanje je, kako temu streči. Prva dilema, ki pravi, da ni mogoče o tem času napisati ničesar novega, je še najlažje obvladljiva. Pri vsakršnem resnem in metodološko osmišljenem raziskovanju namreč že teoretično ne moremo vedeti, do kakšnih interpretativnih ugotovitev bomo prišli. Ravno tako so vprašanja, ki smo si jih zastavili včeraj, morda čisto drugačna in nebistvena v primerjavi z vprašanji, ki nas zanimajo danes. Druga dilema, ki pravi, da je sodobni čas za zgodovinarja premlad, je do neke mere upravičena. Gotovo je enostavneje raziskovati oddaljen in zaključen proces, kakor današnji, na videz kaotičen čas. Toda prednost, ki jo predstavlja distanca, v sebi skriva nemajhno past – vedenje o koncu. Znanemu koncu (posledici) bomo iskali logične vzroke v ravnanjih ljudi in pri tem pozabili, da se v zgodovini stvari dogajajo tudi takrat, ko jih nihče ne načrtuje. Problematika virov je še najlažje obvladljiva. Vse vire naše dobe – tako klasične, znane že iz preteklih dob, kakor novejše (digitalne) - lahko temeljito analiziramo in pretehtamo le ob pritegnitvi dveh načinov pristopa – z <span style="font-style:italic">interdisciplinarnostjo</span> in s pomočjo orodij, ki jih danes ponuja <span style="font-style:italic">digitalna humanistika</span>. Raziskovanje sodobnosti se namreč bolj in bolj osredotoča na teme in probleme, pri čemer padajo meje med posameznimi disciplinami.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>In kaj lahko po opravljenem raziskovanju sklepamo o politični zgodovini zadnjega četrt stoletja? Najprej se gotovo potrjuje ugotovitev, da je naša doba zelo <span style="font-style:italic">dinamična</span>, dogodkovno gosta in <span style="font-style:italic">»neberljiva«</span>. Navkljub relativni politični stabilnosti vlad je bil strankarski prostor nestabilen in spreminjajoč, v neprekinjenem prestrukturiranju. Med večjimi konstantami je bila <span style="font-style:italic">polarizacija</span> - delitev političnih akterjev na slovensko levico in desnico. Poleg tega lahko slovenskemu razvoju pripišemo tudi nekatere od značilnosti, ki so jih zaznali v širšem evropskem prostoru – <span style="font-style:italic">personalizacijo</span> politike, <span style="font-style:italic">medializacijo</span> in <span style="font-style:italic">informalizacijo</span>. Eden raziskovalnih izzivov za prihodnost je podrobno proučevanje strankarsko-politične dinamike – ne le navzven, po možnosti tudi znotraj strank, v kolikor bi bilo raziskovalcu to omogočeno. Interdisciplinarno sodelovanje pri tem ne sme izostati, saj je problematika večplastna, odgovori pa ne nujno racionalni.</p></div><!--Notes in [TEI]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Opombe</div><div class="note" id="ftn1"><span class="noteLabel">* </span><div class="noteBody"><span style="font-weight:bold">senior researcher, PhD, Institute of Contemporary History, Kongresni trg 1, 1000 - Ljubljana, Slovenia,<a class="link_ref" href="mailto:jure.gasparic@inz.si">jure.gasparic@inz.si</a></span></div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn1_return">↵</a></div><div class="note" id="ftn2"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><div class="noteBody">Jiří Suk, "Od nezmožnosti politiky k politice jako umění možného.

It has a national shipbuilding industry and its own airline, a stock exchange, its World Trade Center and other institutions. With 892,000 people in employment, it boasts a per capita GDP of US$ 9,150 and an inflation rate of 8.9 per cent. It introduced its own currency, the Slovene tolar, it has strong foreign exchange reserves, and a tax system that is increasingly in tune with that of Western Europe. The former socially-owned companies have been (almost) entirely privatised. Business activities are increasingly liberal, the exchange rate is favourable, the interest rate is high in real terms and fiscal policy envisages minimal budget deficits. Slovenia is rapidly becoming a transport hub, with the shortest route connecting France and Italy with Hungary (Milan-Ljubljana-Budapest), and the Balkans with Central Europe (Zagreb- Ljubljana-Munich). In the political arena it has become established as a partner and adviser on the margin of the turbulent Balkans. From its acceptance into the United Nations up to its membership of the Security Council, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international institutions and also to becoming the most serious candidate country for membership of Nato and the European Union, it is mapping out the path of a recognised and established state in the modern world. It is an up-to-date, progressive democracy, while at the same time it has retained the unique image of a small nation that has not just survived millennia of foreign influence and rule, but has also entered into the new order as a winner.« – <span style="font-style:italic">Slovenia - 10 Years of Independence,</span> 30 May 2016, <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.slovenija2001.gov.si/10years/independence/">http://www.slovenija2001.gov.si/10years/independence/</a>.</div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn7_return">↵</a></div><div class="note" id="ftn8"><span class="noteLabel">7. </span><div class="noteBody">The description of 2013 is based on my text about the sixth term of the National Assembly.
