            <p><hi rend="italic">The discussion focuses on the issue of reconciliation, which had
                become increasingly notable in the Slovenian society since the middle of the
                1980s and culminated in the ceremony in the Kočevski rog forest in July 1990.
                Even before that solemn event, the Presidency of the Socialist Republic of
                Slovenia and the Slovenian Regional Episcopal Conference gave statements with
                regard to this issue, which, however, differed from each other significantly.
                The Presidency of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia emphasised that the purpose
                of the national and civil appeasement was especially to establish "such a
                situation in the political and public life of Slovenia where the past no longer
                represents a burden for interpersonal relations", while the statement of the
                Episcopal Conference underlined that "only the truth can set us free, represent
                the basis for reconciliation, and pave the way towards appeasement". In the last
                twenty-five years the different ways of understanding the question of
                reconciliation led to the oppositions and ideological divisions in the Slovenian
                society deepening even further with every reconciliatory declaration.</hi></p>

                tem vprašanju podala predsedstvo SRS in slovenska pokrajinska škofovska
                konferenca, ki pa sta se vsebinsko znatno razlikovali. Predsedstvo SRS je
                poudarjalo, da je smisel narodne in državljanske umiritve predvsem v
                vzpostavitvi »takih razmer v političnem in javnem življenju Slovenije, ko
                preteklost ne bo več obremenjevala medčloveških odnosov«, medtem ko je izjava

                sprave je v zadnjih petindvajsetih letih privedlo do tega, da se nasprotja in

            <p>On 8 July 1990 a ceremony took place in the Kočevski rog forest,
                attended by the highest representatives of the political and public life, including
                the President of the Presidency of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia. The
                Metropolitan Archbishop Dr Alojzij Šuštar held a mass. The solemn event was supposed

            <p>Before that, on 4 March 1990, the Presidency of the Socialist

                        Socialist Republic of Slovenia (1988-1990). Pleterski later explained his
                        attitude towards reconciliation in the article "O NOB in spravi," ["On the

                    This is the problem of the national and civil appeasement 45 years after the end
                    of the war. In the interest of public well-being, the national politics should
                    aim to eliminate any possibility of a contemporary division of the

            <p>The statement of the Presidency of the Socialist Republic of
                Slovenia represented a substantial turning point in the attitude towards
                reconciliatory processes, as it elevated this issue to the level of state
                institutions. Namely, until then the reconciliatory initiatives had come exclusively
                from the ranks of the civil society. </p>
            <p> On 9 May 1990 (in April 1990 the first free and democratic
                elections in Slovenia after 1927 took place), the newly-elected President of the
                Assembly France Bučar opened his inaugural address with the following words:</p> <quote>"<hi rend="italic">More than feeling dutifully thankful for the trust invested in me

                    of the turning point that the current moment represents for the Slovenian
                    nation. By constituting this Assembly we can assume that the civil war that has
                    been beleaguering and hindering us for almost half a century is finally at an
                    end.</hi>"<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="6">

            <p>In such an atmosphere the newly-elected President of the
                Presidency of the Republic of Slovenia Milan Kučan, in his address of the Members of
                Assembly, explained the reasons for the necessity to carry out the reconciliatory
                process with the following words: </p><quote>"<hi rend="italic">The Presidency of Slovenia
                    recently adopted a statement on the national and civil appeasement. This was
                    soon followed also by the statement of the Slovenian Episcopal Conference on the
                    national reconciliation. These actions went a long way towards the
                    reconciliation of all Slovenians and towards ensuring a rightful peace among us,
                    in order to prevent the foreboding ghosts of the past – divisions, treason,
                    hatred and civil war – from still being summoned today. The purpose of the
                    reconciliation, which is a historical necessity and our cultural and
                    civilisational duty, is to eradicate our painful obsession with the past,
                    because we must live on. Nations preoccupied with the past threaten their
                    present and give up their future.</hi>
                <hi rend="italic">Reconciliation can neither be achieved nor experienced by those
                    who keep hating. We can only achieve it by consciously and responsibly
                    refraining from inciting new hatred from the old ashes. Without trying to fix or
                    conceal our history, we are duty-bound to correct the injustice where that is
                    still possible and apologise to each other for whatever was wrong with our
                    actions during the war and after it. The whole nation can come to terms with its
                    own history only if we allow history to finally become the past, if we finally
                    bury our dead, and if we forgive.</hi> (…) <hi rend="italic">I am firmly
                    convinced, as are all members of the Presidency of Slovenia, that this very
                    Assembly, in this form and in this pivotal time, has been called upon to finally
                    take this historical step, so crucial for our nation, and acknowledge that all
                    Slovenians are entitled to their homeland. We should prevent any of the future
                    generations, born into the world burdened by the hatred of others, from having
                    to endure the task of purification, reconciliation and appeasement.</hi>"<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="7"> Milan Kučan's address

                    appeasement is a goal that the Church shall pursue to the best of its ability,
                    and it wishes to honestly cooperate with everyone who holds this goal dear.
                    However, appeasement cannot be ordered or forced. Reconciliation is the only
                    path towards this goal, and without it there cannot be a permanent and true
                    appeasement. Therefore reconciliation is the first and most crucial task.</hi>
                (…) <hi rend="italic">As far as this is concerned, we should first take into account
                    the reconciliation with the dead and then the reconciliation with the living.
                    The latter cannot exist without the former.</hi> (…)

                    all the events since the beginning of the last war until today. Only truth can
                    set us free and serve as the basis for reconciliation, which would allow for
                    appeasement. Thus the primary task is to objectively ascertain and publish all
                    the facts, in so far as that is possible, on the basis of documents and
                    testimonies. The unresolved past cannot simply be forgotten or erased,
                    especially as until now so many fabrications have been spread, or it has not

            <p>On 2 July 1990, shortly before the reconciliatory ceremony in
                the Kočevski rog forest, the Pravičnost in mir (Justice and Peace) commission
                released a statement entitled <hi rend="italic">For a Deeper Understanding of
                    Reconciliation</hi>, signed by Anton Stres. It expressed the expectations of the
                Roman Catholic Church in Slovenia with regard to the question of reconciliation far
                more directly:</p> <quote>"<hi rend="italic">Before the funeral ceremony of those killed in the
                    Kočevski rog forest, our community as well as the emigrant public still strongly
                    expresses numerous and sometimes very diverse attitudes towards the so-called
                    reconciliation. There are many misunderstandings and imprecise assessments of
                    the intentions of either side. Therefore it is appropriate that we might once
                    again clarify the purpose of the funeral ceremony in Kočevski rog and explain
                    the connection between this event and reconciliation, which will undoubtedly
                    take much longer. The Kočevski rog forest is the resting place of the people
                    killed by the side, victorious in the war, in order to simply erase them from
                    our memory. With the funeral ceremony we want to restore the most basic human
                    dignity owed to the dead: that they are counted among the dead and that they
                    have their own graves.</hi> (…)<hi rend="italic">We are aware of the fact that
                    this does not conclude, but merely begins the process of reconciliation. As it
                    is, reconciliation cannot be ensured without truth, as thorough as possible: and
                    the path towards this truth is still long. We will only be able to reach it by
                    overcoming a variety of preconceptions, especially the prejudice stemming from
                    our different ideologies.</hi> (…)<hi rend="italic">Therefore we cannot agree
                    with those who believe that the past should simply be forgotten. That would mean
                    that we just want to cover up rather than heal the wound. Even worse: it would
                    mean that the injustice should be left uncorrected – which is the same as
                    agreeing to it. Of course, it is clear that it will not be possible to
                    completely right all the wrongs. However, also for this reason we are morally
                    bound to try and do at least what we can.</hi>"<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="13"> "Za globlje razumevanje sprave. Izjava komisije

            <p>With this official standpoint the Roman Catholic Church in
                Slovenia joined the reconciliatory efforts and started acting as an advocate of the
                undisclosed victims' interests. In relation to the state it attempted to assert
                itself as an equal partner and partly also as the only true representative of the
                Slovenian nation or at least as its supreme moral authority. </p>
            <p>A variety of civil initiatives may have surfaced with regard to
                the question of reconciliation, at least in the initial period, for example those
                proposed by the United under the Linden Tree of Reconciliation civil society
                (Združeni ob lipi sprave, Stanislav Klep) or the New Slovenian Covenant (Nova
                slovenska zaveza). However, these were more or less variations that were basically
                identical as the standpoints expressed by the leadership of the Roman Catholic
                Church in Slovenia in 1990. </p>
            <p>Otherwise the reconciliation initiative had already been taken
                in the pivotal days of May 1945. At its session at Tabor on 3 May 1945, the National
                Committee for Slovenia had drawn up a "proclamation" calling upon "<hi rend="italic">all Slovenians to ensure a general reconciliation in order to release and unite

                <hi rend="italic">Having learned from my experience with the reconciliatory ceremony
                    in Kočevski rog and the intentional diminishment of its significance, my opinion
                    was that the situation was not yet ready for such a resolution. Otherwise I
                    think that resolutions are not the proper way of addressing this question. I see
                    reconciliation as the maturity of the nation, capable of saying at a certain
                    moment: This is our history, our past. It happened, with all its good and its
                    bad. We have to take it as our own and live with it. Resolutions, symbols and
                    monuments are fine, but they will not lead to any results by themselves. For as
                    long as reconciliation is not in the interest of the politics, it will not
                    happen. I see reconciliation especially as an intimate human act. However, I
                    often ask myself whether anything can be more reconciliatory among Slovenians as
                    the joint creation of the state and the current responsibility for its
                    future.</hi>
                <hi rend="italic">Unfortunately, Slovenian politics refused to recognise this act as
                    an act of reconciliation. Otherwise I am convinced that what Slovenia lacks is
                    an anti-fascist agreement, and this impedes reconciliation as I understand it.

            <p>Who is responsible for such a state of affairs in the Slovenian
                society? The answer may not be completely unequivocal, as it seems that such a
                situation actually suits many people on both sides, in a way. However, differences
                were already evident in the very definition of the foundations of the reconciliatory
                process in the aforementioned statements of the Presidency of the Socialist Republic
                of Slovenia and the Slovenian Episcopal Conference. While the former focuses
                especially on the aspect of piety involved in reconciliation and recommends that the
                resolution of the pressing issues from the past be depoliticised, in this regard the
                Roman Catholic Church has made very resolute demands for the re-evaluation of the
                past, which it has supported with the line of reasoning that "<hi rend="italic">only
                    truth can set us free and function as the basis for reconciliation, which would
                    allow for appeasement</hi>".<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn39" n="38"> Dolinar,

                Despite these very obvious differences, today it is completely clear that the core
                of the problem nonetheless lies especially in the manner of dealing with the past,
                which is still seen in a number of diverse ways in the Slovenian society. In view of
                the fact that until the events related to the fall of the Berlin Wall a biased image
                of World War II had been dominant in Slovenia, it became clear that this war should
                nevertheless be interpretatively updated and placed in a new balance. In fact, this
                should actually be beyond any doubt. However, what had at its initial stages been a
                completely legitimate demand to clarify the past has not developed into a
                constructive dialogue, aimed at a comprehensive analysis of the wartime events by
                means of an unbiased, scientifically irreproachable method. As it happened, the
                demands for "<hi rend="italic">reconciliation on the basis of truth</hi>" soon
                turned into a struggle for the interpretative dominance in the Slovenian society and
                did not always adhere to scientific standards. In this sense the process was an
                attempt to assert the methods that Braco Rotar shrewdly described with the title of
                his contribution <hi rend="italic">Reconciliation Instead of History</hi><note place="foot" xml:id="ftn40" n="39"> Rotar, "Sprava

            <p>If we keep our distance and look at how the reconciliatory
                issues have developed after the time when the question of the national
                reconciliation became topical in the Slovenian society, especially thanks to
                Spomenka Hribar, and until today, we can ascertain that the predictions of the
                analysts of the contemporaneous State Security Service have largely come true. These
                analysts assessed, already back in 1986, that the "<hi rend="italic">goal of the
                    'national reconciliation' is to ensure that the defeated forces have enough

            <p>Thus it is characteristic for the advocates of the "emigrant"
                interpretation or, as they claim themselves, for the supporters of the new,
                ideologically unburdened views that they operate extremely confidently, often even
                aggressively; and first and foremost their side keeps bringing up the topics that
                should supposedly still be studied or re-evaluated. In a part of the Slovenian
                historiography the emigrant explanation has in fact asserted itself as a credible
                interpretation of the wartime events. In the name of the "struggle for the truth",
                ever since the ideological relaxation in the middle of the 1980s its advocates have
                in fact – by selectively emphasising certain topics – dictated the orientation
                according to which the developments during World War II in Slovenia should be
                understood. </p>
            <p>On the other hand, after the fall of the Berlin Wall the left
                has suffered an identity crisis and gone on the defensive: it seems as if it lacks
                any vision and that it is unable to find solutions to problems, related to the
                attitude towards the past which is seen as disputable by the society. Many adherents
                of the left have experienced significant difficulties with accepting the fact that
                interpretative pluralism has become completely legitimate also in the Slovenian
                society. Therefore – at least as far as the exploration of the ambiguous periods of
                the recent history is concerned – one of the basic characteristics of the
                representatives of the left is their exceedingly defensive posture. In the
                interpretative sense it is also possible to note a lack of innovative approaches in
                the substantive as well as methodological sense.</p>
            <p>However, in contrast with such trends, visibly present in the Slovenian society, the
                newest analyses of this issue, carried out by the author of this text, have refuted
                the "emigrant" theory in its entirety: not only as biased and black-and-white, but
                also as a completely implausible explanation without any basis in

                Ever since 1995 official efforts had been invested in the exhumation of Rožman's
                mortal remains and reburial in his homeland, and the precondition of the Church was
                his rehabilitation, as "<hi rend="italic">first we have to annul the unjust process

                Vatican in written correspondence with the then President of the State Kučan, "<hi rend="italic">that the reburial should depend on Rožman's legal and political
                    rehabilitation</hi>".<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn46" n="45"> Ibid.</note> Naturally, such endeavours do not
                only call for the re-evaluation of Rožman's wartime role, but rather, in view of the
                symbolic significance and his vital role in the time of the occupation, also for the
                rehabilitation of all that he stood for during the war. One of the key arguments for
                the proposal on the renewal of the judicial process against Rožman was the alleged
                "new evidence". This evidence supposedly exonerated the convicted Bishop, of course.
                Some of this evidence had in fact existed already during the initial trial, but the
                military court refused to take it into account regardless of being aware of it.
                However, it is true that also other, new and aggravating evidence came to light
                later. This evidence was not taken into account and suitably placed in the
                contemporaneous historical context by the authors of the historical expertise,
                consisting of two independent parts<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn47" n="46"> France M. Dolinar and Tamara Griesser-Pečar, <hi rend="italic">Rožmanov proces</hi> [The Rožman Process] (Ljubljana:

                historical basis for the proposal on the renewal of the criminal proceedings in the
                "Rožman Case". It is a fact that this evidence – especially certain published
                diplomatic and military documents originating in Germany, Italy and the Vatican –
                would have made it much easier for the court, had it had these documents at its
                disposal at the time, to pass a much more transparent judgement, which would have
                been, from the viewpoint of its historical credibility, impossible to refute even
                according to the legal order and values of the today's Slovenian society.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn48" n="47"> Bojan Godeša, "O

                Even though the results of this research had not yet been presented at the time,
                President Kučan's opinion, expressed in the correspondence with the Vatican State

                and political rehabilitation of Bishop Rožman. Instead it should be seen merely as a
                pious act, stemming from Rožman's right to his grave.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn49" n="48">

                    </note> In view of the most recent historiographical discoveries, this
                opinion has nevertheless turned out to be much more appropriate, also from the
                viewpoint of the historical credibility.</p>
            <p>In the discussion <hi rend="italic">Slovenian Historical Burden</hi> that the German
                historian Joachim Hösler, who also wrote a few monographs on the Slovenian history,
                prepared for the needs of the German politics, Hösler establishes the following:</p> <quote><hi rend="italic">"During World War II nationalism meant survival for the Partisans
                    and the Home Guard. Today it functions as an ideology of reconciliation. In this
                    regard the 'national unity' and 'collective identity' are merely illusions of
                    reality, supported by intellectuals and politicians. Democratic and plural
                    societies cannot and simply do not need to become 'one'. Much can be achieved
                    already with an open and civilised discussion about the conflict of
                    interests</hi>."<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn50" n="49"> Joachim Hösler, "Sloweniens historische Bürde," <hi rend="italic">Aus

            <p>However, this way of shedding light on the wartime developments has not prevailed in
                the Slovenian society. It seems that the opinion closest to Hösler's – at least as
                far as the question of the national reconciliation is concerned – is that of
                Spomenka Hribar, who, in her essay <hi rend="italic">Guilt and Sin</hi> in the
                middle of the 1980s, established the problem of reconciliation as a
                socially-relevant question.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn51" n="50"> Spomenka Hribar, "Krivda in greh," ["Guilt and Sin"]
                        in: <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Kocbekov zbornik, </hi>ed.
                        Dimitrij Rupel (Maribor: Založba Obzorja, 1987), 6–68.</note> In the
                Razgledi magazine in 1994, Hribar argued for a completely different standpoint with
                regard to the role of reconciliation, as it was understood (especially) in the
                Church circles. She emphasised the following:</p> <quote>"<hi rend="italic">Not many issues
                    involve as many misunderstandings as the question of reconciliation, since the
                    dominant opinion is that reconciliation: 1) is related to the past and it is
                    supposedly meant to 'manage' the past affairs; and 2) concerns the wartime
                    opponents, which should thus 'reconcile', and they should achieve this by
                    admitting to a single interpretation (the Truth) about the dispute. According to
                    such reasoning it is logical that reconciliation is actually supposed to involve
                    the political rehabilitation or even victory of what has until now been the
                    unstated truth against the opposite side, or that the 'new' truth is supposed to
                    be a kind of a combination of both interpretations. As this is impossible, of
                    course, we can establish that reconciliation is an unattainable goal, a dream,
                    an ideology, an eternal imperative, the work of Sisyphus, and after all – 'that
                    reconciliation'! And what does reconciliation have to do with the past? Nothing
                    at all! The past is what it used to be! There is nothing to change and revise.
                    It is the task of the historians to explore the past and keep explaining it
                    again and again, from new viewpoints. Meanwhile, reconciliation matters to us,
                    here and now, because we have a future ahead of us. It is a new beginning, a
                    consensus that the future will not be like the past, because that would be
                    devastating! Reconciliation is not the eradication of differences, but rather
                    quite the opposite – an a priori assent to these differences. Therefore it
                    presupposes diversity: various political standpoints, obstacles, interpretations
                    of history and one's own role in it, ideas and dreams about the future, personal
                    truths, political interests – the only presupposition of all these
                    dissimilarities is that people – those who subscribe to and declare all these
                    legitimate and humanly justifiable differences – wish to and want to live in
                    harmony. In this sense – and only in this sense – reconciliation also involves
                    an attitude towards the past, as it consciously puts an end to one period and
                    begins another. If this is not so – if reconciliation does not exist – the old
                    keeps dragging on!</hi>" <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn52" n="51"> Spomenka

            <head>POVZETEK</head>
                <docAuthor>Bojan Godeša</docAuthor>
                <p>Kot temeljno značilnost razčiščevanja medvojne preteklosti v
                zadnjih 25 letih lahko prizadevanja za spravo v sintetični obliki sklenemo z
                ugotovitvijo: z vsako spravno deklaracijo se nasprotja in ideološke delitve v
                slovenski družbi le še poglabljajo.</p>
            <p>Kdo je odgovoren za tako stanje v slovenski družbi? Odgovor sicer ne more biti povsem
                enoznačen, glede na to, da se zdi, da takšne razmere na neki način pravzaprav
                ustrezajo mnogim na obeh straneh. Razlike so bile razvidne že v opredelitvi izhodišč
                za spravni proces v omenjenih izjavah predsedstva SRS in Slovenske škofovske
                konference. Medtem, ko prva izpostavlja predvsem pietetni vidik spravnega dejanja
                ter priporoča depolitizacijo pri reševanju perečih vprašanj iz preteklosti, pa je
                RKC v tem pogledu zelo odločno postavila zahtevo po prevrednotenju preteklosti, kar
                so utemeljevali, da »edino resnica nas more osvoboditi, biti podlaga za spravo in
                omogočiti pot k pomiritvi«. Kljub tem zelo očitnim razlikam, je danes vendarle že
                povsem jasno, da je jedro problema vendarle predvsem v načinu obravnave preteklosti,
                o kateri v slovenski družbi sicer obstajajo zelo razlikujoče se ocene. Glede na to,
                da je do dogodkov, povezanih s padcem berlinskega zidu, prevladovala pristranska
                podoba druge svetovne vojne na Slovenskem, je postalo jasno, da jo je vsekakor treba
                interpretativno posodobiti in spraviti v novo ravnovesje. O tem pravzaprav ne bi
                smelo biti nobenega dvoma. Vendar se v osnovi popolnoma legitimna zahteva po
                razčiščevanju preteklosti ni razvila v prevlado konstruktivnega dialoga, ki bi bil z
                nepristranskim, znanstveno neoporečnim pristopom usmerjen k celoviti obravnavi
                medvojnega dogajanja. Kmalu se je namreč zahteva »po spravi, katere pogoj je
                resnica«, sprevrgla v boj za interpretativno prevlado v slovenski družbi, ki ne
                upošteva vedno znanstvenih meril.</p>
            <p>Razlaga zagovornikov medvojnega s kolaboracijo obremenjenega
                protikomunističnega tabora se je tudi v delu slovenskega zgodovinopisja po
                osamosvojitvi uveljavila kot verodostojna interpretacija medvojnega dogajanja.
                Vendar so najnovejše poglobitve v to problematiko, ki jih je opravil pisec teh
                vrstic, »emigrantsko« tezo v celoti ovrgle, in to ne le kot pristransko in
                črno-belo, temveč kot popolnoma neverodostojno razlago, ki nima podlage v znanstveno
                preverljivih dejstvih. Najbolj prepričljivo se je neverodostojnost te interpretacija
                pokazala v zahtevi po sodni in politični rehabilitaciji ljubljanskega škofa dr.
                Gregorija Rožmana.</p>
            <p>Eden ključnih razlogov za predlog po obnovitvi procesa proti Rožmanu naj bi bili tudi
                »novi dokazi«, ki naj bi seveda razbremenjevali obsojenega škofa. Vendar v
                zgodovinski ekspertizi Rožmanov proces, ki je
                predstavljala historiografsko podlago predloga za obnovo kazenskega postopka v
                »zadevi Rožman«, avtorja nista upoštevala oz. nista na ustrezen način umestila v
                tedanji historični kontekst vseh dosegljivih dokumentov. Dejstvo je, da bi ti
                dokumenti, ki so bili odkriti kasneje, sodišču, če bi z njimi razpolagalo, olajšali
                podati mnogo bolj transparentno obsodbo. Te ne bi bilo moč na podlagi
                historiografske verodostojnosti zavrniti niti s stališč pravnega reda, niti z vidika
                političnih vrednot, na katerih temelji današnja slovenska demokratična in pluralna
                družba. Rožman je bil leta 2007 in nato 2009 sicer sodno rehabilitiran zaradi
                očitnih postopkovnih napak v procesu leta 1946. Sicer pa na podlagi omenjenih
                razkritij sodobne slovenske historiografije za Rožmanovo politično rehabilitacijo ne
                obstajajo nikakršni razlogi, ki bi izvirali iz znanstveno preverljivih dejstev.</p>
