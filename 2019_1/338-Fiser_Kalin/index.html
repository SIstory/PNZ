Izvedene analize so pokazale, da v primerjavi z zasebnimi računi v korporativnih tvitih izrazito prevladujejo standardne jezikovne prvine formalnega sporočanja, sicer redkejše neformalne in nestandardne izbire pa so uporabljene premišljeno glede na naslovnika sporočila in namen sporočanja.

Our analysis shows that, in comparison to private accounts, corporate tweets predominantly use formal communication and standard language characteristics with seldom usage of informal and non-standard choices. In the event of those, however, they are chosen deliberately to address a specific target audience and meet the desired communicative goals.

Coding of the observed phenomena is manual. The research framework is quantitative but done on a relatively small scale, and experimental in that research hypotheses are confirmed or rejected with statistical tests. Our work differs from this research framework in that we use an existing large corpus of tweets and are interested in the characteristics of all the available corporate accounts in it. While coding of certain phenomena (e.g. account type, user gender) was manual, it was performed prior to this study by coders unrelated to this study, so could not be fully controlled. Coding of many other phenomena (e.g. language, sentiment and standardness level of tweets) was automatic and therefore contains a certain degree of noise. Our approach is not only quantitative but large scale as well, taking into account several thousands of users and several million of their tweets, and is descriptive in nature. What is more, unlike most related work which mostly observe the metadata (e.g. tweet frequency, following behavior, retweets) or content of the messages (e.g. hyperlinks, hashtags, mentions, sentiment), we also perform an analysis of the language used in the messages, which is still underresearched in communication studies. A better understanding of the language practices used by public companies and institutions for presentation, persuasion and reputation management on social media will contribute towards a comprehensive understanding of contemporary, technology-enhanced corporate public relations and marketing strategies and practices. Finally, while most researchers focus almost exlusively on English, our study is performed on Slovene which can serve as a showcase for other languages with a smaller number of speakers (and therefore a smaller market size the corporate accounts are serving).</p></section><section class="teidiv0" id="index-body.1_div.3"><header><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head">Corpus Analysis of Corporate Communication on Twitter</span></h2></header><p id="index-p-d46e243"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The analysis has been performed on the Janes-Tweet corpus (<a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="#Erjavec.2018" title="Erjavec Tomaž Nikola Ljubešić and Darja Fišer. 2018.

There are 9% more private users with 1,000 – 10,000 tweets and a similar percentage fewer private accounts with only 100 – 1,000 tweets. In the years included in the Janes-Tweet corpus, the volume of content generated by the corporate users is stable but is decreasing slightly among the private users (see Figure 1). Occasional sharp drops in the number of posts, which are simultaneous for both user groups, were caused by the technical issues during data collection and are not related to the seasonal fluctuations or other content-related phenomena.</p><div class="table-scroll" itemprop="table"><table><caption>Table 3: Activity of corporate and private users in the Janes-Tweet corpus.</caption><tr itemprop="row"><th></th><th colspan="2">Corporate</th><th colspan="2">Private</th></tr><tr itemprop="row"><td>No. of all accounts</td><td style="text-align:right;">2612</td><td style="text-align:right;">%</td><td style="text-align:right;">7627</td><td style="text-align:right;">%</td></tr><tr itemprop="row"><td>&gt; 10,000 tweets</td><td style="text-align:right;">29</td><td style="text-align:right;">1.11%</td><td style="text-align:right;">129</td><td style="text-align:right;">1.69%</td></tr><tr itemprop="row"><td>Between 10,000 and 1,000 tweets</td><td style="text-align:right;">422</td><td style="text-align:right;">16.16%</td><td style="text-align:right;">1867</td><td style="text-align:right;">24.48%</td></tr><tr itemprop="row"><td>Between 1,000 and 100 tweets</td><td style="text-align:right;">1640</td><td style="text-align:right;">62.79%</td><td style="text-align:right;">4055</td><td style="text-align:right;">53.17%</td></tr><tr itemprop="row"><td>&lt; 100 tweets</td><td style="text-align:right;">521</td><td style="text-align:right;">19.95%</td><td style="text-align:right;">1576</td><td style="text-align:right;">20.66%</td></tr></table></div><figure class="figure" itemprop="figure"><figcaption class="caption" itemprop="head"><b></b>Figure 1: Posting dynamics of corporate and private users in the Janes-Tweet corpus. according to the number of posted tweets between June 2013 and June 2017.</figcaption><img src="image1.png" alt="Figure 1: Posting dynamics of corporate and private users in the&#xA;                            Janes-Tweet corpus. according to the number of posted tweets between&#xA;                            June 2013 and June 2017." class="graphic" itemprop="graphic" /></figure><p id="index-p-d46e450"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span><span style="font-weight:bold" itemprop="hi">Post length.</span> Figure 2 shows that the length of corporate tweets is more homogenous than the length of private tweets.

Interestingly, half of the 10 most frequently used hashtags are shared (sport, news, Ljubljana). Among the 10 corporate users with the highest relative frequency of hashtag use we can find less formal magazines and companies. Therefore, for a more detailed analysis of corporate communication it would be interesting to further divide corporate users into different groups: media (journals and magazines), companies, state institutions and non-governmental organizations.

The only exception are the accounts of Slovene Embassies around the world often posting in their local language (e.g. in French), as well as the accounts of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the president and the prime minister who occasionally use English tweets to inform the international community about major events (e.g. arbitration).</p><div class="table-scroll" itemprop="table"><table><caption>Table 9: Language use in the tweets posted by corporate and private users.</caption><tr itemprop="row"><th style="border:0.5px solid #333333;" rowspan="2">Language</th><th style="border:0.5px solid #333333;" colspan="2">Corporate</th><th style="border:0.5px solid #333333;" colspan="2">Private</th></tr><tr itemprop="row"><th style="border:0.5px solid #333333;">No. of tweets</th><th style="border:0.5px solid #333333;">%</th><th style="border:0.5px solid #333333;">No. of tweets</th><th style="border:0.5px solid #333333;">%</th></tr><tr itemprop="row"><td>Slovene</td><td style="text-align:right;">1,973,677</td><td style="text-align:right;">93.41%</td><td style="text-align:right;">8,074,681</td><td style="text-align:right;">87.54%</td></tr><tr itemprop="row"><td>English</td><td style="text-align:right;">104,955</td><td style="text-align:right;">4.97%</td><td style="text-align:right;">983,141</td><td style="text-align:right;">10.66%</td></tr><tr itemprop="row"><td>Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian</td><td style="text-align:right;">16,058</td><td style="text-align:right;">0.76%</td><td style="text-align:right;">57,017</td><td style="text-align:right;">0.62%</td></tr><tr itemprop="row"><td>Other</td><td style="text-align:right;">18,220</td><td style="text-align:right;">0.86%</td><td style="text-align:right;">108,897</td><td style="text-align:right;">1.18%</td></tr><tr itemprop="row"><td>Total</td><td style="text-align:right;">2,112,910</td><td style="text-align:right;">100.00%</td><td style="text-align:right;">9,223,736</td><td style="text-align:right;">100.00%</td></tr></table></div><p id="index-p-d46e1115"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span><span style="font-weight:bold" itemprop="hi">Sentiment of tweets.</span> Every tweet in the corpus is annotated with a sentiment label (see <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="#Erjavec.2018" title="Erjavec Tomaž Nikola Ljubešić and Darja Fišer. 2018.

itemprop="hi">Orthography.</span> Great differences are detected regarding the use of abbreviations: corporate tweets mainly contain standard abbreviations of academic or other titles (<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">dr., mag., d. o. o.</span>) and common abbreviations (<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">št., oz., min.</span>), while in private tweets we find nonstandard abbreviations (<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">tw</span>), often without full stop (<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">slo, lj, min</span>). Some differences can be also observed in the use of punctuation. In corporate accounts, a bigger range of classic punctuation marks is used according to the orthographic norm. Tweets by private users are characterized by frequent repetitions of the same punctuation mark to give the message an emotional charge. Much more frequent is also the use of social-media specific symbols (<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">#, @, *</span>).</p><p id="index-p-d46e1388"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span><span style="font-weight:bold" itemprop="hi">Parts of speech.</span> The analysis of the parts of speech in the language of corporate tweets offers an insight into communication purposes of corporate accounts. Relatively speaking, there are almost twice as many proper nouns and numerals in corporate tweets than in private ones. Much more frequent are also conjunctions, prepositions, adjectives and common nouns. As shown in Table 10, interjections are considerably more often present in private accounts (3.5 times more). The same is true for particles (almost 2 times more), pronouns and adverbs. On the one hand this confirms a greater formality of corporate users and reflects a more direct and personal approach of private users. On the other hand this also reflects different communicative functions of Twitter: informative for corporate and conversational for private accounts. Furthermore, the informative, as well as the influencing function to some extent, are also confirmed by the detailed analysis of individual parts of speech presented below.</p><p id="index-p-d46e1393"><span class="numberParagraph">6</span><span style="font-weight:bold" itemprop="hi">The noun. </span>Common nouns are 1.5 times more common in corporate tweets than in private ones, but the matching rate of the first 20 common nouns that are most frequently used is surprisingly high (70%): <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">dan/day, leto/year, tekma/race, ura/hour, mesto/place, teden/week, čas/time, hvala/thank you, svet/world, delo/work, človek/human, konec/end, otrok/child, država/country</span>. Among the 20 most frequent nouns, the following are specific to corporate tweets: <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">video/video, foto/photo, zmaga/victory, novica/news, cena/price, sezona/season</span>. Proper nouns are twice as common in corporate tweets than in the private ones and the matching rate of the 20 most frequent nouns is 40%: <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Slovenija/Slovenia, Ljubljana, Maribor, EU, Slovenc/Slovene, Evropa/Europe, ZDA/USA, Cerar, Janša</span>.

The reason for grammatical plurality lies in the fact that authors of corporate tweets use formal communication methods on behalf of their institution or company and formal form of addressing.</p><p id="index-p-d46e1422"><span class="numberParagraph">8</span><span style="font-weight:bold" itemprop="hi">The verb.</span> The use of main verbs is more common in private tweets.

Among the 20 most frequent verbs, the following main verbs are specific to corporate tweets: <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">želeti/wish, preveriti/check, najti/find, iskati/search, prebrati/read, gledati/watch, moči/able, hoteti/want, narediti/do</span>.</p><p id="index-p-d46e1433"><span class="numberParagraph">9</span><span style="font-weight:bold" itemprop="hi">The adjective.</span> Adjectives are 1.5 times more frequently used in corporate than in private tweets and the matching rate of the 20 most used adjectives is 50%: <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">nov/new, dober/good, slovenski/Slovenian, velik/big, lep/beautiful, zadnji/last, mlad/young, star/old, pravi/real, super/super</span>.

Social media and the Evolution of Corporate Communications.The Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research in ...">Matthews 2010</a>). This paper presents the results of the first comprehensive, large-scale and corpus-driven analysis of the characteristics of corporate communication on Twitter in Slovenia that could serve as a starting-point of further, data-driven and linguistically enhanced investigations of the importance of social media for fostering corporate communication. In the study, we combined the analysis of the available metadata, Tweet content and corpus annotations to study three key aspects of the communication of Slovene corporate Twitter users: (1) the participation, posting dynamics and posting volume, (2) the utilization of new media elements, and (3) the language choices observed through several levels of linguistic discription.</p><p id="index-p-d46e2176"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Based on the Janes-Tweet corpus, Twitter appears to be mainly used for private communication in Slovenia. The majority of corporate accounts belong to the low-activity category but the volume of content generated by the corporate users is stable. Corporate tweets are more homogenous length-wise and are predominantly longer than those of private users.</p><p id="index-p-d46e2177"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>The analysis of the usage of the new media elements suggests that corporate tweets come short of the true dialogic approach as most Slovene companies and institutions use Twitter as yet another channel for unidirectional communication of regular (shortened) PR messages, while the prevalent communication function remains informative and positively presentational. This can be seen from a much less frequent usage of emoticons and all other interactive elements typical of private accounts, which display a distinct conversational communication function that can be seen in their frequent usage of non-standard particles, interjections, punctuation and language, and a large number of favourites.</p><p id="index-p-d46e2178"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>A very strong feature of corporate communication is the almost exclusive usage of Slovene which is undoubtedly strategic with a clear focus on the Slovene market. While standard language and formal elements do prevail in corporate tweets of Slovene companies and institutions, the infrequent occurrences of informal and non-standard elements seem to be used deliberately and tailored to the specific target audience, which points towards a growing awareness of adapting the style to the content that is communicated (level of formality, linguistic standardness, discursiveness), target audience (general public – neutral style vs. specific public – variations between neutral and colloquial style) and the organization profile (public institution – neutral style, standard language, companies – visible, colloquial, non-standard features).</p><p id="index-p-d46e2179"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>Both sentiment- and part-of-speech-based keyword analyses show an interesting landscape of corporate tweets. The usage of evaluative adjectives is prominent throughout this subcorpus, among which superlatives stands out in particular. The negative keywords originate from the coverage of accidents and crimes by the media, and the positive fully correspond with the definition of promotional elements. These results indicate an important difference between the negative reporting-style tweets by the news outlets, and the positive promotional style of companies, public institutions and non-governmental institutions, suggesting the need for a more fine-grained categorization of corporate accounts, which will be refined in our future work. We also plan to focus on analyzing the reception of corporate tweets which contain non-standard language and interactive elements which are more typical of private communication on social media.</p><p id="index-p-d46e2180"><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>An important original contribution of this study is its demonstration of the methodological potential of corpus approaches in communication studies, media studies and related disciplines in social sciences which are based on language data, which is not yet utilized in the Slovene context. Apart from theoretical relevance, the results of this analysis therefore also have practical implications for PR practitioners and organizations in that they reinforce the importance of properly trained PR practitioners who use social media in a dialogic, two-way symmetrical model, understand their role as boundary spanners and the need to seek opportunities to engage in and stimulate dialogue with stakeholders. The results of our study also clearly illustrate to the PR practitioners that social media should not be treated as just another means through which to disseminate the same advertisements and publicity pieces that stakeholders are already receiving through other traditional media channels.

In communication studies, three main strands of research into corporate communication practices on social media can be identified: posting behaviour, content analysis and perception studies. Investigators are mostly interested in corporate communication styles, reputation management and corporate social responsibility. A better understanding of the language practices used by public companies and institutions for presentation, persuasion and reputation management on social media is still lacking. </p><p id="index-p-d46e2379"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>This paper addresses this gap with the first comprehensive, large-scale and corpus-driven analysis of the characteristics of corporate communication on Twitter in Slovenia. In the study, we combined the analysis of the available metadata, Tweet content and corpus annotations in the Janes-Tweet corpus to study three key aspects of the communication of Slovene corporate Twitter users: (1) their participation, posting dynamics and posting volume, (2) the use of social-media specific communication elements, and (3) the language choices observed through several levels of linguistic discription. </p><p id="index-p-d46e2380"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Our analysis shows that, in comparison to private accounts, corporate tweets predominantly use formal communication and standard language characteristics with seldom usage of informal and non-standard choices. In the event of those, however, they are chosen deliberately to address a specific target audience and meet the desired communicative goals. The analysis of the utilisation of the new media elements by corporate users clearly show that their tweets come short of the true dialogic approach and that most Slovene companies and institutions use Twitter as yet another channel for unidirectional communication of regular (shortened) PR messages in which the prevalent communication function remains informative and positively presentational. A keyword analysis reveals an important difference between the negative reporting-style tweets by the news outlets, and the positive promotional style of companies, public institutions and non-governmental institutions, suggesting the need for a more fine-grained categorization of corporate accounts, which will be refined in our future work.</p><p id="index-p-d46e2381"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Another major contribution of the paper is its demonstration of the methodological potential of corpus approaches in communication studies, media studies and related disciplines in social sciences that are based on language data, which is not yet utilized in the Slovene context. Apart from theoretical relevance, the results of this analysis therefore also have practical implications for the PR community which highlight the importance of properly trained PR practitioners who use social media in a dialogic, symmetrical model, understand their role as boundary spanners and the need to seek opportunities to engage in and stimulate dialogue with their stakeholders. </p></section><section lang="sl" class="summary" id="index-back.1_div.3"><p class="docAuthor">Darja Fišer, Monika Kalin Golob</p><header><h2 lang="sl"><span class="head" itemprop="head">SLOVENSKO KORPORATIVNO SPOROČANJE NA DRUŽBENEM OMREŽJU TWITTER: KORPUSNA ANALIZA</span><br class="subheader" itemprop="head" /><span class="subheader" itemprop="head">POVZETEK</span></h2></header><p id="index-p-d46e2387"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>V zadnjem desetletju so z omogočanjem neposrednega in takojšnjega stika z deležniki družbena omrežja močno vplivala tudi na korporativno kominiciranje. V komunikologiji korporativne komunikacijske prakse na družbenih omrežjih raziskujejo z opazovanjem vedenja korporativnih uporabnikov, analizo vsebine in percepcijskimi študijami. Komunikologe zanimajo predvsem slogi poslovnega sporočanja, upravljanje ugleda in družbena odgovornost podjetij, medtem ko še vedno primanjkujejo jezikoslovno usmerjene raziskave, ki bi omogočile boljše razumevanje jezikovnih praks, ki jih podjetja in institucije uporabljajo za predstavljanje svojih izdelkov, vplivanje na potrošnike in odzivanje v kritičnih situacijah.</p><p id="index-p-d46e2388"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>To vrzel naslavlja pričujoči prispevek, v katerem predstavimo prvo celovito, na obsežnem korpusu zasnovano analizo korporativnega komuniciranja med slovenskimi uporabniki družbenega omrežja Twitter. Izvedli smo jo s kombinacijo besedilnih podatkov, metapodatkov in korpusnih oznak, ki so na voljo v korpusu Janes-Tviti, pri analizi pa smo se osredotočili na tri vidike korporativnega komuniciranja v slovenskih uporabnikov: (1) njihovo prisotnost, aktivnost, dinamiko in količino objav, (2) rabo novomedijskih komunikacijskih elementov in (3) jezikovne izbire, opazovane na različnih ravneh jezikovnega opisa.</p><p id="index-p-d46e2389"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Izvedene analize so pokazale, da v primerjavi z zasebnimi računi v korporativnih tvitih izrazito prevladujejo standardne jezikovne prvine formalnega sporočanja, sicer redkejše neformalne in nestandardne izbire pa so uporabljene premišljeno glede na naslovnika sporočila in namen sporočanja. Analiza izkoriščanja novomedijskih elementov jasno kaže, da komuniciranje slovenskih korporativnih uporabnikov na družbenem omrežju Twitter ne sledi dialoškemu pristopu in da večina slovenskih podjetij in institucij Twitter razume kot dodatni kanal za enosmerno sporočanje klasičnih (skrajšanih) sporočil za javnost, sporočanjska vloga katerih ostaja pretežno informativna in pozitivno predstavitvena. Analiza ključnih besed razkrije pomembno razliko med negativnim poročanjskim slogom medijskih računov in med pozitivnim promocijskim slogom podjetij, javnih ustanov in nevladnih organizacij, kar nakazuje na potrebo po natančnejši kategorizaciji korporativnih računov v korpusu, ki jo načrtujemo za prihodnje raziskave. </p><p id="index-p-d46e2390"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Pričujoči prispevek je dragocen tudi zato, ker demonstrira potencial korpusnih pristopov v komunikologiji, medijskih študijah in drugih sorodnih družboslovnih disciplinah, ki temeljijo na jezikovnih podatkih, kar v slovenskem okolju še ni ustaljena praksa. Poleg teoretične relevantnosti imajo rezultati predstavljene analize tudi praktično vrednost za komunikološko stroko, saj izpostavljajo pomen ustrezno usposobljenih strokovnjakov za odnose z javnostmi, ki obvladajo dialoški, simetričen model družbenih omrežij, razumejo svojo posredniško vlogo med deležniki in podjetjem, ki ga zastopajo, ter proaktivno iščejo priložnosti za navezovanje pristnih stikov z deležniki in spodbujajo dialog z njimi.</p></section></div><!--Notes in [TEI]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Notes</div><div class="note" id="ftn1"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn1_return"><sup>*</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">Department of Translation, Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana, Aškerčeva 2, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Department of Knowledge Technologies, Jožef Stefan Institute, Jamova cesta 39, SI-1000 Ljubljana, darja.fiser@ff.uni-lj.si</span></p></div><div class="note" id="ftn2"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn2_return"><sup>**</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">Chair of Journalism, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana, Kardeljeva ploščad 5, SI-1000 Ljubljana, monika.kalin-golob@fdv.uni-lj.si</span></p></div><div class="note" id="ftn3"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn3_return"><sup>1.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">The corpus is publically available for <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="https://www.clarin.si/repository/xmlui/handle/11356/1142">download</a> as well as for <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="https://www.clarin.si/noske/run.cgi/corp_info?corpname=janes_tweet">on-line querying</a> through the CLARIN.SI research infrastructure.</span></p></div><div class="note" id="ftn4"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn4_return"><sup>2.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">Emoticons (e.g. ;)) are combinations of standard typographical characters used for expressing emotions.
