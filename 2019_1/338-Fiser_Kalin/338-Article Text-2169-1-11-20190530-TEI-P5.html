Na koncu smo proučili še ključne besede v korporativnih objavah. Izvedene analize so pokazale, da v primerjavi z zasebnimi računi v korporativnih tvitih izrazito prevladujejo standardne jezikovne prvine formalnega sporočanja, sicer redkejše neformalne in nestandardne izbire pa so uporabljene premišljeno glede na naslovnika sporočila in namen sporočanja.

We compare the amount, posting dynamics and use of social-media specific communication elements by Slovene corporate and private users. Next, we analyse the language of corporate users. Our analysis shows that, in comparison to private accounts, corporate tweets predominantly use formal communication and standard language characteristics with seldom usage of informal and non-standard choices. In the event of those, however, they are chosen deliberately to address a specific target audience and meet the desired communicative goals. A major contribution of the paper is also a showcase of corpus-based approaches in communication studies, media studies and other related disciplines in social sciences which study language use.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Keywords: corporate communication, social media, Twitter, corpus analysis</span></p></div><!--TEI body--><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">Introduction</span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>In the past decade, social media have evolved into a powerful tool, attracting millions of users every day (boyd and Ellison 2007). Jansen et al. (2010) have shown that around 20 percent of all published tweets mentioned or expressed their opinion about an organization, brand, product or service. What is more, Wu et al. (2011) show that this new form of electronic word-of-mouth is approximately 20 times more effective than marketing events and 30 times more effective than media appearances. It is therefore unsurprising to see such a rapid growth of the online social media marketing (Griffiths and McLean 2014) through which companies address a wide range of goals, such as increased traffic and brand awareness, improved search engine rankings or increased sales (Thoring 2011). In addition, social media can also be used for customer service and market research (Weber 2009).</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>With the growing commercial relevance of social media, researchers have begun to study the nature and influence of corporate communication on social media. Researchers who investigate the patterns of how information spreads through the Twitter network showed that tweets which contain URLs tend to spread faster (Park et al. 2012) and that tweets containing words which indicate either positive or negative sentiment tend to receive more retweets than neutral posts (Stieglitz and Dang-Xuan 2012). Stelzner (2010) and Heaps (2009) showed that marketers use social media mainly for generating exposure for their business and increasing traffic to their corporate websites, rather than for selling products and services. Evidence has also been found that social media have a positive effect on increasing relational outcomes, such as online reputation and relationship strength (Clark and Melancon 2013; Li et al. 2013; Miller and Tucker 2013). It is therefore surprising that while the new platform of engagement with customers has shifted the company–customer discourse, Mangold and Faulds (2009) show that communication is still predominantly scripted, promotion-centric and lacks real interaction with the customers.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>In this paper we present the results of the first large-scale analysis of corporate communication on Twitter in Slovenia. We look into the production, dynamics and language in the tweets of Slovene corporate users in order to identify the characteristics of such communication in contrast to the communication of private Twitter users. In our study, we use the term corporate account for all private companies, public institutions, the media and interest associations who do not post as individuals for leisure purposes. The analysis was performed on the corpus Janes-Tweet (Erjavec et al. 2018) by combining the available user and text metadata with the content of the tweets, which enabled a more accurate contextualization, parametrization, comparison and generalizations of language use in a specific communicative context.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>The rest of the paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we present related work relevant for our study, in section 3, we present the results of the corpus analysis and Section 4 concludes the paper and outlines future work.</p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Related work</span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>In communication studies, three main strands of research into corporate social media communication practices can be identified. The first group focuses on investigating posting behaviour, the second looks into content analysis, and the third are perception studies. In terms of research focus, investigators are mostly interested in corporate communication styles, reputation management and corporate social responsibility.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Quantitative differences in communication dynamics, style and content of Slovene private and corporate Twitter users have been identified by Ljubešić and Fišer (2016) and have been attributed to the different communication functions of private and corporate social media users. While corporate users mostly tweet during the work week in the morning, private users are more active during weekends and in the evening. Corporate tweets have distinctly positive sentiment, while private tweets are predominantly neutral. Tweets posted by corporate users are retweeted much more often while private tweets are more frequently favourited.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>By analyzing tweet frequency, following behavior, hyperlinks, hashtags, mentions and retweets, several studies have shown that one-way communication is still the most common communication strategy used by organizations on Twitter (Waters and Jamal 2011; Xifra and Grau 2010) and that the style and genre in tweets by PR professionals is the same as in other PR text types, treating social media as yet another channel for reaching a different consumer segment, without adapting their language accordingly (Kalin Golob et al. 2018). However, as shown by Kwon and Sung (2011), the growing frequency of imperative verb phrases, such as "follow the brand," "come by the booth," "join us at the event," or "sign up" for a planned occasion, suggest that corporations increasingly use Twitter as a tool to initiate and maintain relationships with consumers. Risius and Beck (2015) empirically identified social media activities in terms of social media management strategies (using social media management tools or the web-frontend client), account types (broadcasting or receiving information), and communicative approaches (conversational or disseminative). They found positive effects of social media management tools, broadcasting accounts, and conversational communication on public perception. Company account characteristics that have been found to influence public perception are verification, friends, and status.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Gomez and Chalmeta (2013) used content analysis to look into corporate social responsibility (CSR) on social media and have identified presentation, content, and interactivity as the key resources for CSR communication on social media. Presentation refers to the different tools and basic information that supports the company’s CSR presence on social media. Content includes messages related to CSR and other topics that reinforce the communication of CSR practices. Interactivity refers to the type of CSR communication and the frequency of CSR messages and feedback.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>Li et al. (2013) used social identity theory to identify design factors that determine the social context of a corporate Twitter channel and users’ social identification with the community. They confirm that user engagement and informedness in a corporate Twitter channel have a positive effect on corporate reputation and that the credibility of the corporate Twitter channel has a positive effect on user informedness about the corporation. An interesting finding is that deeper relationships among users of a corporate Twitter channel result in higher user engagement and informedness when the level of corporate involvement with the channel is high and the channel has a specific purpose but that the opposite is true when the channel has a generic purpose.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>In the related work, post harvesting is typically tailor-made and small-scale, either focused on a few carefully selected corporate social media accounts (e.g. 3 companies), or limited to a carefully designed time span (e.g. 1 month). Coding of the observed phenomena is manual. The research framework is quantitative but done on a relatively small scale, and experimental in that research hypotheses are confirmed or rejected with statistical tests. Our work differs from this research framework in that we use an existing large corpus of tweets and are interested in the characteristics of all the available corporate accounts in it. While coding of certain phenomena (e.g. account type, user gender) was manual, it was performed prior to this study by coders unrelated to this study, so could not be fully controlled. Coding of many other phenomena (e.g. language, sentiment and standardness level of tweets) was automatic and therefore contains a certain degree of noise. Our approach is not only quantitative but large scale as well, taking into account several thousands of users and several million of their tweets, and is descriptive in nature. What is more, unlike most related work which mostly observe the metadata (e.g. tweet frequency, following behavior, retweets) or content of the messages (e.g. hyperlinks, hashtags, mentions, sentiment), we also perform an analysis of the language used in the messages, which is still underresearched in communication studies. A better understanding of the language practices used by public companies and institutions for presentation, persuasion and reputation management on social media will contribute towards a comprehensive understanding of contemporary, technology-enhanced corporate public relations and marketing strategies and practices. Finally, while most researchers focus almost exlusively on English, our study is performed on Slovene which can serve as a showcase for other languages with a smaller number of speakers (and therefore a smaller market size the corporate accounts are serving).</p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">Corpus analysis of corporate communication on Twitter</span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The analysis has been performed on the Janes-Tweet corpus (Erjavec et al. 2018) consisting of 11.3 million Slovene tweets or 160 million tokens published by more than 10,200 users. Depending on their communication purpose, users in the corpus are manually divided into two groups: private and corporate. Corporate accounts comprise all private companies, public institutions, the media and interest associations who do not post as individuals for leisure purposes, who are treated as private accounts.

In the years included in the Janes-Tweet corpus, the volume of content generated by the corporate users is stable but is decreasing slightly among the private users (see Figure 1).

picture where a much greater share of corporate tweets have at least one retweet (17%) in comparison to private tweets (8%), suggesting a higher informative value of corporate tweets for a wider audience. Interestingly, when considering very frequently retweeted posts, no difference between the two account types has been observed.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">6</span><span style="font-weight:bold">Use of hashtags. </span>Relatively speaking, corporate accounts use hashtags almost twice as often as private accounts. On average, almost every second corporate tweet contains a hashtag, which holds for only every fourth private tweet. As presented in Table 5, sport is the predominant topic of the 10 most frequent hashtags used by corporate users which is very similar to private users. Interestingly, half of the 10 most frequently used hashtags are shared (sport, news, Ljubljana). Among the 10 corporate users with the highest relative frequency of hashtag use we can find less formal magazines and companies. Therefore, for a more detailed analysis of corporate communication it would be interesting to further divide corporate users into different groups: media (journals and magazines), companies, state institutions and non-governmental organizations. We plan to include this in our future studies.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">7</span><span style="font-weight:bold">Use of emoticons and emojis.</span><span id="ftn4_return"><a class="notelink" title="Emoticons (e.g. ;)) are combinations of standard typographical characters used for expressing emotions.

This is not surprising because the main objective of PR tweets is self-presentation, which is why referencing others is less needed.

Some differences can be also observed in the use of punctuation. In corporate accounts, a bigger range of classic punctuation marks is used according to the orthographic norm.

The same is true for particles (almost 2 times more), pronouns and adverbs. On the one hand this confirms a greater formality of corporate users and reflects a more direct and personal approach of private users. On the other hand this also reflects different communicative functions of Twitter: informative for corporate and conversational for private accounts. Furthermore, the informative, as well as the influencing function to some extent, are also confirmed by the detailed analysis of individual parts of speech presented below.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">10</span><span style="font-weight:bold">The noun. </span>Common nouns are 1.5 times more common in corporate tweets than in private ones, but the matching rate of the first 20 common nouns that are most frequently used is surprisingly high (70%): <span style="font-style:italic">dan/day, leto/year, tekma/race, ura/hour, mesto/place, teden/week, čas/time, hvala/thank you, svet/world, delo/work, človek/human, konec/end, otrok/child, država/country</span>.

The 20 top-ranking keywords with positive sentiment correspond to the definitions of positive PR communication (e.g., <span style="font-style:italic">čestitka/congratulations, vabljen/invited, bravo/bravo, čudovit/wonderful, polepšati/make sbd’s (day)</span>). Adjectives and adverbs with highly positive meaning are also ranked high (e.g., <span style="font-style:italic">lep/beautiful, odličen, odlično/fantastic, prijeten/nice, super/super</span>). Furthermore, the 20 top-ranking keywords with neutral sentiment are part of the tweets containing media reports (e.g., <span style="font-style:italic">novice.si/news.si, zemljišče/property, napovednik/preview, sklepen/final</span>) and denote events (e.g., <span style="font-style:italic">pivniški/beer, ebel/ebel, šloganje/card-reading, prerokovanje/fortune-telling</span>) or names (<span style="font-style:italic">katarinin, ebel, zoofa, apod</span>).

This paper presents the results of the first comprehensive, large-scale and corpus-driven analysis of the characteristics of corporate communication on Twitter in Slovenia that could serve as a starting-point of further, data-driven and linguistically enhanced investigations of the importance of social media for fostering corporate communication. In the study, we combined the analysis of the available metadata, Tweet content and corpus annotations to study three key aspects of the communication of Slovene corporate Twitter users: (1) the participation, posting dynamics and posting volume, (2) the utilization of new media elements, and (3) the language choices observed through several levels of linguistic discription.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Based on the Janes-Tweet corpus, Twitter appears to be mainly used for private communication in Slovenia. The majority of corporate accounts belong to the low-activity category but the volume of content generated by the corporate users is stable. Corporate tweets are more homogenous length-wise and are predominantly longer than those of private users.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>The analysis of the usage of the new media elements suggests that corporate tweets come short of the true dialogic approach as most Slovene companies and institutions use Twitter as yet another channel for unidirectional communication of regular (shortened) PR messages, while the prevalent communication function remains informative and positively presentational. This can be seen from a much less frequent usage of emoticons and all other interactive elements typical of private accounts, which display a distinct conversational communication function that can be seen in their frequent usage of non-standard particles, interjections, punctuation and language, and a large number of favourites.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>A very strong feature of corporate communication is the almost exclusive usage of Slovene which is undoubtedly strategic with a clear focus on the Slovene market. While standard language and formal elements do prevail in corporate tweets of Slovene companies and institutions, the infrequent occurrences of informal and non-standard elements seem to be used deliberately and tailored to the specific target audience, which points towards a growing awareness of adapting the style to the content that is communicated (level of formality, linguistic standardness, discursiveness), target audience (general public – neutral style vs. specific public – variations between neutral and colloquial style) and the organization profile (public institution – neutral style, standard language, companies – visible, colloquial, non-standard features).</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>Both sentiment- and part-of-speech-based keyword analyses show an interesting landscape of corporate tweets. The usage of evaluative adjectives is prominent throughout this subcorpus, among which superlatives stands out in particular. The negative keywords originate from the coverage of accidents and crimes by the media, and the positive fully correspond with the definition of promotional elements. These results indicate an important difference between the negative reporting-style tweets by the news outlets, and the positive promotional style of companies, public institutions and non-governmental institutions, suggesting the need for a more fine-grained categorization of corporate accounts, which will be refined in our future work. We also plan to focus on analyzing the reception of corporate tweets which contain non-standard language and interactive elements which are more typical of private communication on social media.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>An important original contribution of this study is its demonstration of the methodological potential of corpus approaches in communication studies, media studies and related disciplines in social sciences which are based on language data, which is not yet utilized in the Slovene context. Apart from theoretical relevance, the results of this analysis therefore also have practical implications for PR practitioners and organizations in that they reinforce the importance of properly trained PR practitioners who use social media in a dialogic, two-way symmetrical model, understand their role as boundary spanners and the need to seek opportunities to engage in and stimulate dialogue with stakeholders. The results of our study also clearly illustrate to the PR practitioners that social media should not be treated as just another means through which to disseminate the same advertisements and publicity pieces that stakeholders are already receiving through other traditional media channels. According to Matthews (2010), social media offers an opportunity for direct and instant corporate communication as well as an opportunity to get back to the ideal basics of public relations – building and maintaining relationships – and to change some of the negative stereotypes typically associated with the industry.</p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.5"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">Acknowledgments</span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The work described in this paper was funded by the Slovenian Research Agency within the national basic research project “Resources, methods, and tools for the understanding, identification, and classification of various forms of socially unacceptable discourse in the information society” (J7-8280, 2017-2019) and the and the Slovenian-Flemish bilateral basic research project “Linguistic landscape of hate speech on social media” (N06-0099, 2019 – 2023).</p></div><!--TEI back--><div class="bibliography" id="index.xml-back.1_div.1"><h2><span class="head">Sources and Literature</span></h2><ul class="listBibl"><li id="index.xml-bibl-d30e2510"><div class="biblfree"><span style="font-size:10pt">boyd, danah m., and Nicole B.

In communication studies, three main strands of research into corporate communication practices on social media can be identified: posting behaviour, content analysis and perception studies. Investigators are mostly interested in corporate communication styles, reputation management and corporate social responsibility. A better understanding of the language practices used by public companies and institutions for presentation, persuasion and reputation management on social media is still lacking.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span><span style="font-size:10pt">This paper addresses this gap with the first comprehensive, large-scale and corpus-driven analysis of the characteristics of corporate communication on Twitter in Slovenia. In the study, we combined the analysis of the available metadata, Tweet content and corpus annotations in the Janes-Tweet corpus to study three key aspects of the communication of Slovene corporate Twitter users: (1) their participation, posting dynamics and posting volume, (2) the use of social-media specific communication elements, and (3) the language choices observed through several levels of linguistic discription.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span><span style="font-size:10pt">Our analysis shows that, in comparison to private accounts, corporate tweets predominantly use formal communication and standard language characteristics with seldom usage of informal and non-standard choices. In the event of those, however, they are chosen deliberately to address a specific target audience and meet the desired communicative goals. The analysis of the utilisation of the new media elements by corporate users clearly show that their tweets come short of the true dialogic approach and that most Slovene companies and institutions use Twitter as yet another channel for unidirectional communication of regular (shortened) PR messages in which the prevalent communication function remains informative and positively presentational. A keyword analysis reveals an important difference between the negative reporting-style tweets by the news outlets, and the positive promotional style of companies, public institutions and non-governmental institutions, suggesting the need for a more fine-grained categorization of corporate accounts, which will be refined in our future work.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span><span style="font-size:10pt">Another major contribution of the paper is its demonstration of the methodological potential of corpus approaches in communication studies, media studies and related disciplines in social sciences that are based on language data, which is not yet utilized in the Slovene context. Apart from theoretical relevance, the results of this analysis therefore also have practical implications for the PR community which highlight the importance of properly trained PR practitioners who use social media in a dialogic, symmetrical model, understand their role as boundary spanners and the need to seek opportunities to engage in and stimulate dialogue with their stakeholders.</span></p></div><div lang="sl" class="summary" id="index.xml-back.1_div.3"><p style="text-align:center;"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span><span style="font-size:10pt">Darja Fišer, Monika Kalin Golob</span></p><p style="text-align:center;"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span><span style="font-size:10pt">SLOVENSKO KORPORATIVNO SPOROČANJE NA DRUŽBENEM OMREŽJU TWITTER: KORPUSNA ANALIZA</span></p><p style="text-align:center;"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span><span style="font-size:10pt">POVZETEK</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span><span style="font-size:10pt">V zadnjem desetletju so z omogočanjem neposrednega in takojšnjega stika z deležniki družbena omrežja močno vplivala tudi na korporativno kominiciranje. V komunikologiji korporativne komunikacijske prakse na družbenih omrežjih raziskujejo z opazovanjem vedenja korporativnih uporabnikov, analizo vsebine in percepcijskimi študijami. Komunikologe zanimajo predvsem slogi poslovnega sporočanja, upravljanje ugleda in družbena odgovornost podjetij, medtem ko še vedno primanjkujejo jezikoslovno usmerjene raziskave, ki bi omogočile boljše razumevanje jezikovnih praks, ki jih podjetja in institucije uporabljajo za predstavljanje svojih izdelkov, vplivanje na potrošnike in odzivanje v kritičnih situacijah.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span><span style="font-size:10pt">To vrzel naslavlja pričujoči prispevek, v katerem predstavimo prvo celovito, na obsežnem korpusu zasnovano analizo korporativnega komuniciranja med slovenskimi uporabniki družbenega omrežja Twitter. Izvedli smo jo s kombinacijo besedilnih podatkov, metapodatkov in korpusnih oznak, ki so na voljo v korpusu Janes-Tviti, pri analizi pa smo se osredotočili na tri vidike korporativnega komuniciranja v slovenskih uporabnikov: (1) njihovo prisotnost, aktivnost, dinamiko in količino objav, (2) rabo novomedijskih komunikacijskih elementov in (3) jezikovne izbire, opazovane na različnih ravneh jezikovnega opisa.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">6</span><span style="font-size:10pt">Izvedene analize so pokazale, da v primerjavi z zasebnimi računi v korporativnih tvitih izrazito prevladujejo standardne jezikovne prvine formalnega sporočanja, sicer redkejše neformalne in nestandardne izbire pa so uporabljene premišljeno glede na naslovnika sporočila in namen sporočanja. Analiza izkoriščanja novomedijskih elementov jasno kaže, da komuniciranje slovenskih korporativnih uporabnikov na družbenem omrežju Twitter ne sledi dialoškemu pristopu in da večina slovenskih podjetij in institucij Twitter razume kot dodatni kanal za enosmerno sporočanje klasičnih (skrajšanih) sporočil za javnost, sporočanjska vloga katerih ostaja pretežno informativna in pozitivno predstavitvena. Analiza ključnih besed razkrije pomembno razliko med negativnim poročanjskim slogom medijskih računov in med pozitivnim promocijskim slogom podjetij, javnih ustanov in nevladnih organizacij, kar nakazuje na potrebo po natančnejši kategorizaciji korporativnih računov v korpusu, ki jo načrtujemo za prihodnje raziskave.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">7</span><span style="font-size:10pt">Pričujoči prispevek je dragocen tudi zato, ker demonstrira potencial korpusnih pristopov v komunikologiji, medijskih študijah in drugih sorodnih družboslovnih disciplinah, ki temeljijo na jezikovnih podatkih, kar v slovenskem okolju še ni ustaljena praksa. Poleg teoretične relevantnosti imajo rezultati predstavljene analize tudi praktično vrednost za komunikološko stroko, saj izpostavljajo pomen ustrezno usposobljenih strokovnjakov za odnose z javnostmi, ki obvladajo dialoški, simetričen model družbenih omrežij, razumejo svojo posredniško vlogo med deležniki in podjetjem, ki ga zastopajo, ter proaktivno iščejo priložnosti za navezovanje pristnih stikov z deležniki in spodbujajo dialog z njimi.</span></p></div><!--Notes in [TEI]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Opombe</div><div class="note" id="ftn1"><span class="noteLabel">* </span><div class="noteBody">Department of Translation, Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana, Aškerčeva 2, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Department of Knowledge Technologies, Jožef Stefan Institute, Jamova cesta 39, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Darja.fiser@ff.uni-lj.si</div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn1_return">↵</a></div><div class="note" id="ftn2"><span class="noteLabel">** </span><div class="noteBody">Chair of Journalism, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana, Kardeljeva ploščad 5, SI-1000 Ljubljana, monika.kalin-golob@fdv.uni-lj.si</div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn2_return">↵</a></div><div class="note" id="ftn3"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><div class="noteBody">The corpus is publically available for <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.clarin.si/repository/xmlui/handle/11356/1142">download</a> as well as for <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.clarin.si/noske/run.cgi/corp_info?corpname=janes_tweet">on-line querying</a> through the CLARIN.SI research infrastructure.</div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn3_return">↵</a></div><div class="note" id="ftn4"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><div class="noteBody">Emoticons (e.g. ;)) are combinations of standard typographical characters used for expressing emotions.
