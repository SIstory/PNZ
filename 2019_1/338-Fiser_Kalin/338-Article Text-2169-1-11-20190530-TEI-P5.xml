                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">V prispevku predstavimo korpusno analizo
                        korporativnega komuniciranja na družbenem omrežju Twitter, ki smo jo s
                        kombinacijo besedilnih in metapodatkov izvedli na korpusu Janes-Tweet.
                        Analizirali smo značilnosti slovenskih korporativnih računov in dinamiko
                        njihovih objav ter analizirali rabo novomedijskih elementov in uporabljenega
                        jezika v korporativnih objavah. Na koncu smo proučili še ključne besede v
                        korporativnih objavah. Izvedene analize so pokazale, da v primerjavi z zasebnimi
                        računi v korporativnih tvitih izrazito prevladujejo standardne jezikovne prvine
                        formalnega sporočanja, sicer redkejše neformalne in nestandardne izbire pa so
                        uporabljene premišljeno glede na naslovnika sporočila in namen sporočanja.
                        Prispevek je dragocen tudi zato, ker demonstrira potencial korpusnih pristopov v
                        komunikologiji, medijskih študijah in drugih sorodnih družboslovnih disciplinah,

                        corporate communication on Twitter, which was performed with a combination of
                        metadata and textual data on the Janes-Tweet corpus. We compare the amount,

                        Slovene corporate and private users. Next, we analyse the language of corporate
                        users. Our analysis shows that, in comparison to private accounts, corporate
                        tweets predominantly use formal communication and standard language
                        characteristics with seldom usage of informal and non-standard choices. In the
                        event of those, however, they are chosen deliberately to address a specific

            <div><head>1. Introduction</head>
            <p> In the past decade, social media have evolved into a powerful tool, attracting
                millions of users every day (boyd and Ellison 2007). Jansen et al. (2010) have shown
                that around 20 percent of all published tweets mentioned or expressed their opinion
                about an organization, brand, product or service. What is more, Wu et al. (2011)
                show that this new form of electronic word-of-mouth is approximately 20 times more
                effective than marketing events and 30 times more effective than media appearances.
                It is therefore unsurprising to see such a rapid growth of the online social media
                marketing (Griffiths and McLean 2014) through which companies address a wide range
                of goals, such as increased traffic and brand awareness, improved search engine
                rankings or increased sales (Thoring 2011). In addition, social media can also be
                used for customer service and market research (Weber 2009).</p>
            <p> With the growing commercial relevance of social media, researchers have begun to
                study the nature and influence of corporate communication on social media.
                Researchers who investigate the patterns of how information spreads through the
                Twitter network showed that tweets which contain URLs tend to spread faster (Park et
                al. 2012) and that tweets containing words which indicate either positive or
                negative sentiment tend to receive more retweets than neutral posts (Stieglitz and
                Dang-Xuan 2012). Stelzner (2010) and Heaps (2009) showed that marketers use social
                media mainly for generating exposure for their business and increasing traffic to
                their corporate websites, rather than for selling products and services. Evidence
                has also been found that social media have a positive effect on increasing
                relational outcomes, such as online reputation and relationship strength (Clark and
                Melancon 2013; Li et al. 2013; Miller and Tucker 2013). It is therefore surprising
                that while the new platform of engagement with customers has shifted the
                company–customer discourse, Mangold and Faulds (2009) show that communication is
                still predominantly scripted, promotion-centric and lacks real interaction with the
                customers.</p>
            <p> In this paper we present the results of the first large-scale analysis of corporate
                communication on Twitter in Slovenia. We look into the production, dynamics and
                language in the tweets of Slovene corporate users in order to identify the
                characteristics of such communication in contrast to the communication of private
                Twitter users. In our study, we use the term corporate account for all private
                companies, public institutions, the media and interest associations who do not post
                as individuals for leisure purposes. The analysis was performed on the corpus
                Janes-Tweet (Erjavec et al. 2018) by combining the available user and text metadata
                with the content of the tweets, which enabled a more accurate contextualization,
                parametrization, comparison and generalizations of language use in a specific
                communicative context.</p>
            <p> The rest of the paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we present related work
                relevant for our study, in section 3, we present the results of the corpus analysis
                and Section 4 concludes the paper and outlines future work.</p></div>
            <div><head>2. Related work</head>
            <p> In communication studies, three main strands of research into corporate social media
                communication practices can be identified. The first group focuses on investigating
                posting behaviour, the second looks into content analysis, and the third are
                perception studies. In terms of research focus, investigators are mostly interested
                in corporate communication styles, reputation management and corporate social
                responsibility.</p>
            <p> Quantitative differences in communication dynamics, style and content of Slovene
                private and corporate Twitter users have been identified by Ljubešić and Fišer
                (2016) and have been attributed to the different communication functions of private
                and corporate social media users. While corporate users mostly tweet during the work
                week in the morning, private users are more active during weekends and in the
                evening. Corporate tweets have distinctly positive sentiment, while private tweets
                are predominantly neutral. Tweets posted by corporate users are retweeted much more
                often while private tweets are more frequently favourited.</p>
            <p> By analyzing tweet frequency, following behavior, hyperlinks, hashtags, mentions and
                retweets, several studies have shown that one-way communication is still the most
                common communication strategy used by organizations on Twitter (Waters and Jamal
                2011; Xifra and Grau 2010) and that the style and genre in tweets by PR
                professionals is the same as in other PR text types, treating social media as yet
                another channel for reaching a different consumer segment, without adapting their
                language accordingly (Kalin Golob et al. 2018). However, as shown by Kwon and Sung
                (2011), the growing frequency of imperative verb phrases, such as "follow the
                brand," "come by the booth," "join us at the event," or "sign up" for a planned
                occasion, suggest that corporations increasingly use Twitter as a tool to initiate
                and maintain relationships with consumers. Risius and Beck (2015) empirically
                identified social media activities in terms of social media management strategies
                (using social media management tools or the web-frontend client), account types
                (broadcasting or receiving information), and communicative approaches
                (conversational or disseminative). They found positive effects of social media
                management tools, broadcasting accounts, and conversational communication on public
                perception. Company account characteristics that have been found to influence public
                perception are verification, friends, and status.</p>
            <p> Gomez and Chalmeta (2013) used content analysis to look into corporate social
                responsibility (CSR) on social media and have identified presentation, content, and
                interactivity as the key resources for CSR communication on social media.
                Presentation refers to the different tools and basic information that supports the
                company’s CSR presence on social media. Content includes messages related to CSR and
                other topics that reinforce the communication of CSR practices. Interactivity refers
                to the type of CSR communication and the frequency of CSR messages and feedback.</p>
            <p> Li et al. (2013) used social identity theory to identify design factors that
                determine the social context of a corporate Twitter channel and users’ social
                identification with the community. They confirm that user engagement and
                informedness in a corporate Twitter channel have a positive effect on corporate
                reputation and that the credibility of the corporate Twitter channel has a positive
                effect on user informedness about the corporation. An interesting finding is that
                deeper relationships among users of a corporate Twitter channel result in higher
                user engagement and informedness when the level of corporate involvement with the
                channel is high and the channel has a specific purpose but that the opposite is true
                when the channel has a generic purpose.</p>
            <p> In the related work, post harvesting is typically tailor-made and small-scale,
                either focused on a few carefully selected corporate social media accounts (e.g. 3
                companies), or limited to a carefully designed time span (e.g. 1 month). Coding of
                the observed phenomena is manual. The research framework is quantitative but done on
                a relatively small scale, and experimental in that research hypotheses are confirmed
                or rejected with statistical tests. Our work differs from this research framework in
                that we use an existing large corpus of tweets and are interested in the
                characteristics of all the available corporate accounts in it. While coding of
                certain phenomena (e.g. account type, user gender) was manual, it was performed
                prior to this study by coders unrelated to this study, so could not be fully
                controlled. Coding of many other phenomena (e.g. language, sentiment and
                standardness level of tweets) was automatic and therefore contains a certain degree
                of noise. Our approach is not only quantitative but large scale as well, taking into
                account several thousands of users and several million of their tweets, and is
                descriptive in nature. What is more, unlike most related work which mostly observe
                the metadata (e.g. tweet frequency, following behavior, retweets) or content of the
                messages (e.g. hyperlinks, hashtags, mentions, sentiment), we also perform an
                analysis of the language used in the messages, which is still underresearched in
                communication studies. A better understanding of the language practices used by
                public companies and institutions for presentation, persuasion and reputation
                management on social media will contribute towards a comprehensive understanding of
                contemporary, technology-enhanced corporate public relations and marketing
                strategies and practices. Finally, while most researchers focus almost exlusively on
                English, our study is performed on Slovene which can serve as a showcase for other
                languages with a smaller number of speakers (and therefore a smaller market size the
                corporate accounts are serving).</p></div>
            <div><head>3. Corpus analysis of corporate
                    communication on Twitter</head>
            <p> The analysis has been performed on the Janes-Tweet corpus (Erjavec et al. 2018)
                consisting of 11.3 million Slovene tweets or 160 million tokens published by more
                than 10,200 users. Depending on their communication purpose, users in the corpus are
                manually divided into two groups: private and corporate. Corporate accounts comprise
                all private companies, public institutions, the media and interest associations who
                do not post as individuals for leisure purposes, who are treated as private
                accounts. In order to establish the characteristics of corporate communication on
                Twitter and differentiate them from the common practices typical of this medium in
                general, we perform a contrastive analysis of these two types of accounts.</p>
            <p> Our study consists of three parts, each of which addresses a major segment of
                communication styles on Twitter, ranging from the analysis of communication dynamics
                and metadata to the content and language analysis, observed from the perspective of
                the two types of accounts. First, we analyzed the production and posting dynamics of
                these two user groups. Next, we analyzed the use of social media-specific
                communication elements, such as hashtags, emojis and emoticons. Finally, we analyzed
                the language and keywords used in corporate tweets. All the analyses were performed
                in the SketchEngine corpus-analysis<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="1"> The corpus is publically available for <ref target="https://www.clarin.si/repository/xmlui/handle/11356/1142">download</ref> as well as for <ref target="https://www.clarin.si/noske/run.cgi/corp_info?corpname=janes_tweet">on-line querying</ref> through the CLARIN.SI research
                        infrastructure.</note> suite (Killgarriff et al. 2014).</p>
            <p> The research questions we address with each part of our study are: 1) Does corporate
                communication on Twitter by Slovene users have a distinct corporate profile in terms
                of posting dynamics and volume? 2) Have Slovene corporate users adopted the new
                media communication style and are using the features offered by the new media to
                maximize their reach and relationship strength? 3) Can we identify the Slovene
                corporate tweeting code?</p>

                with 100 – 1,000 tweets. The lowest-activity group includes 521 users (19.95%) who

                In the years included in the Janes-Tweet corpus, the volume of content generated by
                the corporate users is stable but is decreasing slightly among the private users
                (see Figure 1). Occasional sharp drops in the number of posts, which are
                simultaneous for both user groups, were caused by the technical issues during data
                collection and are not related to the seasonal fluctuations or other content-related

                six times more frequently produced by private users, which is not surprising as

                10 likes. This is another strong sign that bidirectional communication is less
                typical of corporate users and that corporate tweets are just one of the channels of
                the same type of (one-directional) communication disseminated through different

            <p>Table 5: Use of hashtags, emoji, hyperlinks and mentions by corporate and private
                users in the Janes-Tweet corpus.</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="bold">Retweets.</hi> Retweeting results show a different picture where a
                much greater share of corporate tweets have at least one retweet (17%) in comparison
                to private tweets (8%), suggesting a higher informative value of corporate tweets
                for a wider audience. Interestingly, when considering very frequently retweeted
                posts, no difference between the two account types has been observed.</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve">Use of hashtags. </hi>Relatively speaking,
                corporate accounts use hashtags almost twice as often as private accounts. On
                average, almost every second corporate tweet contains a hashtag, which holds for
                only every fourth private tweet. As presented in Table 5, sport is the predominant
                topic of the 10 most frequent hashtags used by corporate users which is very similar
                to private users. Interestingly, half of the 10 most frequently used hashtags are
                shared (sport, news, Ljubljana). Among the 10 corporate users with the highest
                relative frequency of hashtag use we can find less formal magazines and companies.
                Therefore, for a more detailed analysis of corporate communication it would be
                interesting to further divide corporate users into different groups: media (journals
                and magazines), companies, state institutions and non-governmental organizations. We
                plan to include this in our future studies.</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="bold">Use of emoticons and emojis.</hi><note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="2"> Emoticons (e.g. ;)) are combinations of standard typographical
                        characters used for expressing emotions. Emojis are pictograms (e.g. <hi style="font-family:Apple Color Emoji">🎂</hi>) which include emotions as
                        well as a broad range of other topics and their usage and interpretation
                        depend on the individual.</note> The usage of emoticons and emojis is
                opposite to hashtags, as emojis are, relatively speaking, more than twice as common
                in posts by private users who use 1.3 emojis or emoticons per tweet on average while
                occurring only in every second corporate tweet which indicates greater degree of
                formality in corporate communication on Twitter. Among the 10 corporate accounts the
                relative frequency of emojis and emoticons, we mainly identified resellers of
                fashion items.</p>
            <p> As presented in Table 6, all of the most frequently used emojis or emoticons are
                positive which again indicates a positive tone in PR communication. However, it is
                interesting that only 2 emojis appear on the top 10 list for corporate users while
                the rest are emoticons. This could be a sign of more conservative communication
                strategies used by corporate users given that emojis are a much more recent
                phenomenon, but this could also be a consequence of corporate users more frequently
                tweeting from their computers rather than smart phones which better support the use
                of emojis. </p>

                <hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve">Use of hyperlinks. </hi>Great differences
                between private and corporate users can be observed in their use of hyperlinks in
                tweets. Relatively speaking, corporate tweets contain more than three times the
                number of hyperlinks in comparison to private tweets. On average, corporate users
                add a hyperlink to nearly each tweet they post, while private users include it only
                in every fourth tweet. This corresponds to the findings of our preliminary analysis
                that tweets are often only compressed press releases leading to a complete message
                in the form of a hyperlink.</p>

                <hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve">Mentions of other users. </hi>Big differences
                between private and corporate users are observed in the rate and type of other user
                accounts mentions. Relatively speaking, mentions are more than twice as frequent in
                private tweets as they are in corporate tweets. On average, private users mention
                other users in every tweet, whereas corporate users use this option only in every
                third message. This is not surprising because the main objective of PR tweets is
                self-presentation, which is why referencing others is less needed. Among the 10 most
                frequently mentioned accounts in corporate tweets are mainly media, political
                institutions/parties/individual politicians and sport organizations, while in
                private tweets we find social media influencers, two journalists and a politician.
                Both lists have only two mentions in common, i.e. YouTube and Janez Janša, one of
                the oldest and best known Slovenian politicians.</p>

                Embassies around the world often posting in their local language (e.g. in French),
                as well as the accounts of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the president and the

                their tweets are written in standard Slovene and the share of tweets containing
                highly nonstandard Slovene is more than four times greater in comparison to

                personalities (e.g. stand-up comics, radio presenters, musicians) who often
                purposefully tweet in nonstandard Slovene because informal communication is a major

            <p>Table 12: Comparison of the language used in corporate and private tweets according
                to part of speech.</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="bold">Orthography.</hi> Great differences are detected regarding the use
                of abbreviations: corporate tweets mainly contain standard abbreviations of academic
                or other titles (<hi rend="italic">dr., mag., d. o. o.</hi>) and common
                abbreviations (<hi rend="italic">št., oz., min.</hi>), while in private tweets we
                find nonstandard abbreviations (<hi rend="italic">tw</hi>), often without full stop
                    (<hi rend="italic">slo, lj, min</hi>). Some differences can be also observed in
                the use of punctuation. In corporate accounts, a bigger range of classic punctuation
                marks is used according to the orthographic norm. Tweets by private users are
                characterized by frequent repetitions of the same punctuation mark to give the
                message an emotional charge. Much more frequent is also the use of social-media
                specific symbols (<hi rend="italic">#, @, *</hi>).</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve">Parts of speech. </hi>The analysis of the parts
                of speech in the language of corporate tweets offers an insight into communication
                purposes of corporate accounts. Relatively speaking, there are almost twice as many
                proper nouns and numerals in corporate tweets than in private ones. Much more
                frequent are also conjunctions, prepositions, adjectives and common nouns. As shown
                in Table 10, interjections are considerably more often present in private accounts
                (3.5 times more). The same is true for particles (almost 2 times more), pronouns and
                adverbs. On the one hand this confirms a greater formality of corporate users and
                reflects a more direct and personal approach of private users. On the other hand
                this also reflects different communicative functions of Twitter: informative for
                corporate and conversational for private accounts. Furthermore, the informative, as
                well as the influencing function to some extent, are also confirmed by the detailed
                analysis of individual parts of speech presented below.</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve">The noun. </hi>Common nouns are 1.5 times more
                common in corporate tweets than in private ones, but the matching rate of the first
                20 common nouns that are most frequently used is surprisingly high (70%): <hi rend="italic">dan/day, leto/year, tekma/race, ura/hour, mesto/place, teden/week,
                    čas/time, hvala/thank you, svet/world, delo/work, človek/human, konec/end,
                    otrok/child, država/country</hi>. Among the 20 most frequent nouns, the
                following are specific to corporate tweets: <hi rend="italic">video/video,
                    foto/photo, zmaga/victory, novica/news, cena/price, sezona/season</hi>. Proper
                nouns are twice as common in corporate tweets than in the private ones and the
                matching rate of the 20 most frequent nouns is 40%: <hi rend="italic">Slovenija/Slovenia, Ljubljana, Maribor, EU, Slovenc/Slovene, Evropa/Europe,
                    ZDA/USA, Cerar, Janša</hi>. Among the 20 most frequent nouns, the following
                proper nouns are corporate tweets: <hi rend="italic">Olimpija, Koper, Peter, Gorica,
                    Janez, Domžale, Luka, Tina, Marko</hi>.</p>
            <p> In corporate tweets a higher level of formality of expression has been detected as
                both first and last names are indicated (private tweets mention only the last name).
                Furthermore, we can observe greater diversity of places and company names. An
                analysis of nominal pronouns returned predictable results: corporate tweets contain
                plural pronouns (<hi rend="italic">nam/to us, nas/us, vam</hi>/<hi rend="italic">to
                    you</hi>), while in private tweets we find singular forms of pronouns (<hi rend="italic">jaz/I, me/of me, ti/to you, te/you</hi>). The reason for
                grammatical plurality lies in the fact that authors of corporate tweets use formal
                communication methods on behalf of their institution or company and formal form of
                addressing.</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve">The verb. </hi>The use of main verbs is more
                common in private tweets. The matching rate of the 20 most frequent verbs in private
                and corporate tweets is 60% (<hi rend="italic">imeti/have, iti/go, morati/must,
                    vedeti/know, videte/see, priti/come, dobiti/get, začeti/begin, čakati/wait,
                    dati/give, praviti/say, delati/work, dobiti/get</hi>), but the difference lies
                in their motivation for communication: corporate accounts mainly report on events
                and publish statements, while private accounts describe personal activities and give
                opinions. Among the 20 most frequent verbs, the following main verbs are specific to
                corporate tweets: <hi rend="italic">želeti/wish, preveriti/check, najti/find,
                    iskati/search, prebrati/read, gledati/watch, moči/able, hoteti/want,
                    narediti/do</hi>.</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve">The adjective. </hi>Adjectives are 1.5 times
                more frequently used in corporate than in private tweets and the matching rate of
                the 20 most used adjectives is 50%: <hi rend="italic">nov/new, dober/good,
                    slovenski/Slovenian, velik/big, lep/beautiful, zadnji/last, mlad/young,
                    star/old, pravi/real, super/super</hi>. Among the 20 most frequent adjectives
                the following are specific to corporate tweets: <hi rend="italic">vabljen/invited,
                    današnji/today’s, evropski/European, javen/public, spleten/web/based,
                    svetoven/world/wide, odličen/excellent, državen/national, visok/high,
                    domač/domestic</hi>. Positive adjectives are characteristic of corporate tweets
                    (<hi rend="italic">nov/new, dober/good, velik/big, lep/beautiful</hi>) which are
                also more formal than the adjectives characteristic of private tweets (<hi rend="italic">vabljen/invited, odličen/excellent, visok/high</hi> vs. <hi rend="italic">hud/badass, mali/little, sam/alone</hi>). Adjectival as well as
                nominal pronouns are used in the first person plural form in corporate tweets (<hi rend="italic">naše/our-Female, naši/our-Male</hi>) when the goal is
                identification with the company or the institution and integration into the
                communicative circle that connects the author of the message on behalf of the
                institution with the recipient (Korošec 1998).</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve">The particle. </hi>The difference between
                formality and informality can also be observed through particles which overlap in
                80% of the cases. However, among the particles that are present only in tweets of
                one user group, our analysis showed that formal particles are distinctive for
                corporate tweets (<hi rend="italic">morda/maybe, predvsem/above all, sicer/though,
                    skoraj/nearly</hi>) and nonstandard and informal particles for private tweets
                    <hi rend="italic">(tud &lt; tudi/also; ze &lt; že/already, itak/off course,
                    pač/well</hi>).</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve">The interjection. </hi>As already mentioned,
                the analysis of this part of speech showed most notable differences. The matching
                rate of the 20 most common interjections in corporate and private tweets is 55%: <hi rend="italic">bravo, hm, haha, uf, o, ej, ah, ha, aha, aja, oh</hi>. Among the
                most frequent interjections that are distinctive for one of the user groups are the
                following ones: <hi rend="italic">živjo, zdravo, hej, hehe, gooool, opa, ups, na,
                    ojoj</hi>. Interjections in corporate tweets are fewer in quantity as well as
                more formal and salutatory (<hi rend="italic">zdravo, ups</hi>), while private
                tweets often contain interjections in foreign language (<hi rend="italic">btw,
                    lol</hi>) and swear words. </p>

            <p> This section highlights the results of the keyword analysis performed on corporate
                tweets. In this paper, the keywords are understood as the words which are
                unexpectedly more frequent in the tweets of corporate users compared to the entire
                Janes-Tweet corpus as reference.</p>

            <p>Table 13: List of 20 most key lemmas in corporate tweets according to sentiment.</p>
            <p>
                <hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve">Sentiment. </hi>As shown in Table 13, the
                highest keyness index is attributed to lexis from corporate tweets with negative
                sentiment. Among those, all 20 top-ranking key lemmas are part of media tweets that
                reference reports on crime and other accidents (e.g., <hi rend="italic">trčenje/collision, evakuirati/evacuate, ranjen/injured, nesreča/accident</hi>).
                The 20 top-ranking keywords with positive sentiment correspond to the definitions of
                positive PR communication (e.g., <hi rend="italic">čestitka/congratulations,
                    vabljen/invited, bravo/bravo, čudovit/wonderful, polepšati/make sbd’s
                (day)</hi>). Adjectives and adverbs with highly positive meaning are also ranked
                high (e.g., <hi rend="italic">lep/beautiful, odličen, odlično/fantastic,
                    prijeten/nice, super/super</hi>). Furthermore, the 20 top-ranking keywords with
                neutral sentiment are part of the tweets containing media reports (e.g., <hi rend="italic">novice.si/news.si, zemljišče/property, napovednik/preview,
                    sklepen/final</hi>) and denote events (e.g., <hi rend="italic">pivniški/beer,
                    ebel/ebel, šloganje/card-reading, prerokovanje/fortune-telling</hi>) or names
                    (<hi rend="italic">katarinin, ebel, zoofa, apod</hi>). This list suggests that
                for a more fine-grained analysis of corporate communication on Twitter it could be
                useful to consider separating the tweets generated by media from those that are
                created by companies or institutions.</p>

                top-ranking key word forms (see Table 14) in corporate tweets written in standard
                and nonstandard Slovene shows that users write in standard Slovene when posting
                notifications and adds (e.g., <hi rend="italic">dražba/auction, ugodne/good,
                    zamudite/miss, preverite/check</hi>). Tweets written in nonstandard Slovene have
                a similar communication purpose, but numerous elements in foreign language and
                nonstandard spelling of Slovene words indicate that authors of such messages want to
                establish a closer connection with their target audience and make their offer more
                appealing to them (e.g. <hi rend="italic">deejaytime/phoneticized spelling of
                    DJ/time, hajskul – phoneticized spelling of high school, najbrš – nonstandard
                    for I guess, pridte –nonstandard for come, dm – abbreviation for direct message,
                    javiš – nonstandard for answer</hi>).</p>

            <p style="text-align:center;"><hi rend="bold">4. Conclusions</hi></p>
            <p> Social media have revolutionized corporate communications by allowing companies to
                communicate directly and instantly with their stakeholders, marking a shift from the
                traditional one-way output of corporate communications, to an expanded dialogue
                between company and consumer (Matthews 2010). This paper presents the results of the
                first comprehensive, large-scale and corpus-driven analysis of the characteristics
                of corporate communication on Twitter in Slovenia that could serve as a
                starting-point of further, data-driven and linguistically enhanced investigations of
                the importance of social media for fostering corporate communication. In the study,
                we combined the analysis of the available metadata, Tweet content and corpus
                annotations to study three key aspects of the communication of Slovene corporate
                Twitter users: (1) the participation, posting dynamics and posting volume, (2) the
                utilization of new media elements, and (3) the language choices observed through
                several levels of linguistic discription.</p>
            <p> Based on the Janes-Tweet corpus, Twitter appears to be mainly used for private
                communication in Slovenia. The majority of corporate accounts belong to the
                low-activity category but the volume of content generated by the corporate users is
                stable. Corporate tweets are more homogenous length-wise and are predominantly
                longer than those of private users.</p>
            <p> The analysis of the usage of the new media elements suggests that corporate tweets
                come short of the true dialogic approach as most Slovene companies and institutions
                use Twitter as yet another channel for unidirectional communication of regular
                (shortened) PR messages, while the prevalent communication function remains
                informative and positively presentational. This can be seen from a much less
                frequent usage of emoticons and all other interactive elements typical of private
                accounts, which display a distinct conversational communication function that can be
                seen in their frequent usage of non-standard particles, interjections, punctuation
                and language, and a large number of favourites.</p>
            <p> A very strong feature of corporate communication is the almost exclusive usage of
                Slovene which is undoubtedly strategic with a clear focus on the Slovene market.
                While standard language and formal elements do prevail in corporate tweets of
                Slovene companies and institutions, the infrequent occurrences of informal and
                non-standard elements seem to be used deliberately and tailored to the specific
                target audience, which points towards a growing awareness of adapting the style to
                the content that is communicated (level of formality, linguistic standardness,
                discursiveness), target audience (general public – neutral style vs. specific public
                – variations between neutral and colloquial style) and the organization profile
                (public institution – neutral style, standard language, companies – visible,
                colloquial, non-standard features).</p>
            <p> Both sentiment- and part-of-speech-based keyword analyses show an interesting
                landscape of corporate tweets. The usage of evaluative adjectives is prominent
                throughout this subcorpus, among which superlatives stands out in particular. The
                negative keywords originate from the coverage of accidents and crimes by the media,
                and the positive fully correspond with the definition of promotional elements. These
                results indicate an important difference between the negative reporting-style tweets
                by the news outlets, and the positive promotional style of companies, public
                institutions and non-governmental institutions, suggesting the need for a more
                fine-grained categorization of corporate accounts, which will be refined in our
                future work. We also plan to focus on analyzing the reception of corporate tweets
                which contain non-standard language and interactive elements which are more typical
                of private communication on social media.</p>
            <p> An important original contribution of this study is its demonstration of the
                methodological potential of corpus approaches in communication studies, media
                studies and related disciplines in social sciences which are based on language data,
                which is not yet utilized in the Slovene context. Apart from theoretical relevance,
                the results of this analysis therefore also have practical implications for PR
                practitioners and organizations in that they reinforce the importance of properly
                trained PR practitioners who use social media in a dialogic, two-way symmetrical
                model, understand their role as boundary spanners and the need to seek opportunities
                to engage in and stimulate dialogue with stakeholders. The results of our study also
                clearly illustrate to the PR practitioners that social media should not be treated
                as just another means through which to disseminate the same advertisements and
                publicity pieces that stakeholders are already receiving through other traditional
                media channels. According to Matthews (2010), social media offers an opportunity for
                direct and instant corporate communication as well as an opportunity to get back to
                the ideal basics of public relations – building and maintaining relationships – and
                to change some of the negative stereotypes typically associated with the
                industry.</p>

                communication on Twitter in Slovenia: A corpus analysis</hi></head>
            <head>SUMMARY</head>
            <p>
                <hi style="font-size:10pt">In the past decade, social media have transformed
                    corporate communications by enabling direct and instant communication with the
                    stakeholders. In communication studies, three main strands of research into
                    corporate communication practices on social media can be identified: posting
                    behaviour, content analysis and perception studies. Investigators are mostly
                    interested in corporate communication styles, reputation management and
                    corporate social responsibility. A better understanding of the language
                    practices used by public companies and institutions for presentation, persuasion
                    and reputation management on social media is still lacking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
                <hi style="font-size:10pt">This paper addresses this gap with the first
                    comprehensive, large-scale and corpus-driven analysis of the characteristics of
                    corporate communication on Twitter in Slovenia. In the study, we combined the
                    analysis of the available metadata, Tweet content and corpus annotations in the
                    Janes-Tweet corpus to study three key aspects of the communication of Slovene
                    corporate Twitter users: (1) their participation, posting dynamics and posting
                    volume, (2) the use of social-media specific communication elements, and (3) the
                    language choices observed through several levels of linguistic discription.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
                <hi style="font-size:10pt">Our analysis shows that, in comparison to private
                    accounts, corporate tweets predominantly use formal communication and standard
                    language characteristics with seldom usage of informal and non-standard choices.
                    In the event of those, however, they are chosen deliberately to address a
                    specific target audience and meet the desired communicative goals. The analysis
                    of the utilisation of the new media elements by corporate users clearly show
                    that their tweets come short of the true dialogic approach and that most Slovene
                    companies and institutions use Twitter as yet another channel for unidirectional
                    communication of regular (shortened) PR messages in which the prevalent
                    communication function remains informative and positively presentational. A
                    keyword analysis reveals an important difference between the negative
                    reporting-style tweets by the news outlets, and the positive promotional style
                    of companies, public institutions and non-governmental institutions, suggesting
                    the need for a more fine-grained categorization of corporate accounts, which
                    will be refined in our future work.</hi></p>
            <p>
                <hi style="font-size:10pt">Another major contribution of the paper is its
                    demonstration of the methodological potential of corpus approaches in
                    communication studies, media studies and related disciplines in social sciences
                    that are based on language data, which is not yet utilized in the Slovene
                    context. Apart from theoretical relevance, the results of this analysis
                    therefore also have practical implications for the PR community which highlight
                    the importance of properly trained PR practitioners who use social media in a
                    dialogic, symmetrical model, understand their role as boundary spanners and the
                    need to seek opportunities to engage in and stimulate dialogue with their
                    stakeholders.</hi>

                SPOROČANJE NA DRUŽBENEM OMREŽJU TWITTER: KORPUSNA ANALIZA</hi></p>
            <p style="text-align:center;"><hi style="font-size:10pt">POVZETEK</hi></p>
            <p>
                <hi style="font-size:10pt">V zadnjem desetletju so z omogočanjem neposrednega in
                    takojšnjega stika z deležniki družbena omrežja močno vplivala tudi na
                    korporativno kominiciranje. V komunikologiji korporativne komunikacijske prakse
                    na družbenih omrežjih raziskujejo z opazovanjem vedenja korporativnih
                    uporabnikov, analizo vsebine in percepcijskimi študijami. Komunikologe zanimajo
                    predvsem slogi poslovnega sporočanja, upravljanje ugleda in družbena odgovornost
                    podjetij, medtem ko še vedno primanjkujejo jezikoslovno usmerjene raziskave, ki
                    bi omogočile boljše razumevanje jezikovnih praks, ki jih podjetja in institucije
                    uporabljajo za predstavljanje svojih izdelkov, vplivanje na potrošnike in
                    odzivanje v kritičnih situacijah.</hi></p>
            <p>
                <hi style="font-size:10pt">To vrzel naslavlja pričujoči prispevek, v katerem
                    predstavimo prvo celovito, na obsežnem korpusu zasnovano analizo korporativnega
                    komuniciranja med slovenskimi uporabniki družbenega omrežja Twitter. Izvedli smo
                    jo s kombinacijo besedilnih podatkov, metapodatkov in korpusnih oznak, ki so na
                    voljo v korpusu Janes-Tviti, pri analizi pa smo se osredotočili na tri vidike
                    korporativnega komuniciranja v slovenskih uporabnikov: (1) njihovo prisotnost,
                    aktivnost, dinamiko in količino objav, (2) rabo novomedijskih komunikacijskih
                    elementov in (3) jezikovne izbire, opazovane na različnih ravneh jezikovnega
                    opisa.</hi></p>
            <p>
                <hi style="font-size:10pt">Izvedene analize so pokazale, da v primerjavi z zasebnimi
                    računi v korporativnih tvitih izrazito prevladujejo standardne jezikovne prvine
                    formalnega sporočanja, sicer redkejše neformalne in nestandardne izbire pa so
                    uporabljene premišljeno glede na naslovnika sporočila in namen sporočanja.
                    Analiza izkoriščanja novomedijskih elementov jasno kaže, da komuniciranje
                    slovenskih korporativnih uporabnikov na družbenem omrežju Twitter ne sledi
                    dialoškemu pristopu in da večina slovenskih podjetij in institucij Twitter
                    razume kot dodatni kanal za enosmerno sporočanje klasičnih (skrajšanih) sporočil
                    za javnost, sporočanjska vloga katerih ostaja pretežno informativna in pozitivno
                    predstavitvena. Analiza ključnih besed razkrije pomembno razliko med negativnim
                    poročanjskim slogom medijskih računov in med pozitivnim promocijskim slogom
                    podjetij, javnih ustanov in nevladnih organizacij, kar nakazuje na potrebo po
                    natančnejši kategorizaciji korporativnih računov v korpusu, ki jo načrtujemo za
                    prihodnje raziskave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
                <hi style="font-size:10pt">Pričujoči prispevek je dragocen tudi zato, ker
                    demonstrira potencial korpusnih pristopov v komunikologiji, medijskih študijah
                    in drugih sorodnih družboslovnih disciplinah, ki temeljijo na jezikovnih
                    podatkih, kar v slovenskem okolju še ni ustaljena praksa. Poleg teoretične
                    relevantnosti imajo rezultati predstavljene analize tudi praktično vrednost za
                    komunikološko stroko, saj izpostavljajo pomen ustrezno usposobljenih
                    strokovnjakov za odnose z javnostmi, ki obvladajo dialoški, simetričen model
                    družbenih omrežij, razumejo svojo posredniško vlogo med deležniki in podjetjem,
                    ki ga zastopajo, ter proaktivno iščejo priložnosti za navezovanje pristnih
                    stikov z deležniki in spodbujajo dialog z njimi.</hi></p></div>
