Običajno se navaja, da sta ga določala relativni družbeni status ter osebna bližina govorca in naslovljenca. Vendar pa je treba še ugotoviti, ali bo statistično strojno učenje potrdilo to tradicionalno razlago. Proučuje se 23 značilnosti, izbranih z različnih jezikoslovnih področij, kot so pragmatika, sociolingvistika in analiza pogovora. Trije uporabljeni algoritmi – naivni Bayesov klasifikator, odločitveno drevo in metoda podpornih vektorjev – so izbrani kot ilustrativni nabor možnih modelov zaradi njihovih kontrastnih predpostavk in učne pristranskosti.

However, it remains to be determined whether statistical machine learning will support this traditional explanation. 23 features are investigated, having been selected from multiple linguistic areas, such as pragmatics, sociolinguistics and conversation analysis. The three algorithms used, Naive Bayes, decision tree and support vector machine, are selected as illustrative of a range of possible models in light of their contrasting assumptions and learning biases. Two predictions are performed, firstly on a binary (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-variant: small-caps">you</span><span style="font-style:italic">/</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-variant: small-caps">thou</span><span style="font-style:italic">) distinction and then on a trinary (you/thou/thee) distinction. Of the three algorithms, the support vector machine models score best. The features identified as the best predictors of pronoun choice are the words in the direct linguistic context. Several other features are also shown to influence the pronoun prediction, including the names of the speaker and addressee, the status differential, and positive and negative sentiment.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span><span style="font-style:italic">Keywords: pronominal address terms, Shakespeare, corpus linguistics, digital humanities, statistical modelling</span></p></div><!--TEI body--><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head"><span style="font-size:14pt;font-weight:bold">Introduction</span></span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>For several decades much research has been undertaken on the use of <span style="font-style:italic">you</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">thou</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">thee</span> in Shakespeare’s works. However, the results so far have yet to arrive at an exact and conclusive answer regarding how these pronouns were used.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>This study combines the strengths of multiple research fields in an effort to determine via hitherto unused methods which linguistic and extra-linguistic features influence the choice of second person singular pronoun (<span style="font-style:italic">you</span> versus <span style="font-style:italic">thou</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">thee</span>) in the plays of William Shakespeare. Prior findings in literary and linguistic studies are utilised to find which features could be relevant in this choice, and tools and applications created for corpus linguistics and computer science are exploited to analyse the data in a more exact way than has so far been accomplished. Through these techniques, I hope to identify which features can contribute to a more accurate prediction of pronoun choice, in a model to mimic the pronoun use of Shakespeare.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>It is worth observing at this point that it has not yet been determined whether it is even possible to predict the pronoun based on linguistic features. Part of the aim of this paper is to make a determination on this point. In other words, is it possible to create a computational model that can predict which pronoun will be used based on a set of linguistic and extra-linguistic features taken from the text itself and selected on the basis of knowledge that we have of English in the late 1500s and early 1600s? To accomplish this, all occurrences of <span style="font-style:italic">you</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">thou</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">thee</span> are extracted from Shakespeare’s plays, and every instance is manually coded for 23 linguistic and extra-linguistic features, creating data which will serve to ascertain the answer to this primary question. A second question to be addressed is whether some features perform better as predictors of the pronoun choice than others. Thirdly, the issue of whether the use of different algorithms affects the prediction outcomes will be considered.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Throughout this paper, italicised <span style="font-style:italic">you</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">thou</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">thee</span> refer to specific pronoun forms. However, whereas <span style="font-style:italic">you</span> – in Early Modern English as in contemporary English – does not exhibit any formal variation for pronoun case, <span style="font-style:italic">thou</span> is strictly a nominative form with <span style="font-style:italic">thee</span> as its accusative/dative form. <span style="font-style:italic">Thou</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">thee</span> are therefore related inflectional forms of a single pronoun lemma; <span style="font-style:italic">you</span> exists in variation with both. Small capitals are used to indicate the pronoun lemmas, thus: <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span>, where <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span> includes both <span style="font-style:italic">thou</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">thee</span>. Whenever discussing pronouns in this paper, I am strictly referring to the singular second-person pronouns <span style="font-style:italic">you</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">thou</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">thee</span> that are examined in this study.</p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head"><span style="font-size:14pt;font-weight:bold">Background</span></span></h2><div class="teidiv1" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">2.1. </span><span class="head"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Digital Humanities</span></span></h3><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Over the past few years, computational research has branched out into other research fields that are not necessarily closely connected to computer science.

The difference between the uses of these two pronouns is evident from multiple literary studies that have addressed Shakespeare’s work, work of his contemporaries, and other documents from this era, such as Walker (2003) and Busse (2002). These studies suggest that unwritten social rules governed the use of these pronouns, abiding by which rules was necessary in order to speak according to society’s standards. The use of the two different pronouns acted as a sign of relative status: <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> would be used to superiors and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span> towards inferiors. The choice of pronoun can thus also operate as a subtle means of showing respect or disrespect; using the pronouns in this way would have been natural and easy to English native speakers of the period.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Shakespeare lived during the Early Modern English period, and thus used both <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span> in his writing. His work was written less than 100 years before <span style="font-style:italic">thou</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">thee</span> disappeared from the standard language (surviving in dialects and archaicised registers, such as pious addresses to the divinity). Thus we may straightforwardly posit that the disappearance of <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span> was likely already in progress around his time. Though obviously heightened in its use of emotional and dramatic language and style to accommodate to the genre of the play script, the language of Shakespeare – including the usage of the two second-person pronouns – can be assumed to be a reasonably good representation of the language used generally in social interaction and conversation at that time (Calvo 1992).</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.3"><h3><span class="headingNumber">2.3. </span><span class="head"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Prior studies on </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-variant: small-caps">you</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">/</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-variant: small-caps">thou</span></span></h3><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Most studies of Shakespeare’s use of <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span> so far have been literary and nonnumeric studies (Brown and Gilman 1960; Quirk 1974; Calvo 1992); the relative few to have used data-based or quantitative techniques did not implement any method beyond directly comparing raw frequency counts (Busse 2003; Mazzon 2003; Stein 2003). Moreover, these studies did not look at all the extant Shakespeare plays, but instead chose a few plays to focus on. Nonetheless, these studies have demonstrated some patterns in the use of <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span> and thus provide a workable foundation for a more in-depth study of the usage of those two pronouns.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>These prior studies support in the overall conclusion that the pronouns <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span> appear to be used to support the explicit expression of respect, social status, and familiarity. Quirk (1974) and Mazzon (2003) characterise the role of the pronoun as a linguistic marker, whose usage can be seen as either marked or unmarked. In other words, the use of a particular pronoun can be seen as marked when it is used unexpectedly, for example when <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> is expected based on social status, but <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span> is used instead. Thus, in contrast to earlier studies (Brown and Gilman 1960), they do not perceive <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span> to be in direct contrast, and to have a more variable interpretation than was assumed until then, based on the context it occurs in. Calvo (1992) and Stein (2003) expand on this by concluding that markedness of the pronoun is dependent on the context and the situation, in addition to the pronoun choice depending on stable factors such as the social statuses of, and the level of familiarity between, the characters in Shakespeare’s plays; the speakers and addressees in this study – rather than <span style="font-style:italic">just</span> the latter factors (Brown and Gilman 1960). The emotive effect of the utterances within which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you/thou</span> distinction is utilised is of importance as well; feelings such as anger and love for another character may find expression through pronoun choice. This is connected to the notion of respect, as, in an angry remark, marked pronouns can be used to disrespect the addressee based on their social status (Stein 2003).</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>As Stein (2003) and Busse (2006) already stressed in their studies, a study of <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span> in Shakespeare cannot and should not be limited to a single research discipline. Rather, what is needed is a combination of literature, sociolinguistics, pragmatics and conversation analysis, which are all useful in capturing the complexity of pronominal address and the social constrictions that may have underpinned the choice of one honorific pronoun-form over the other.</p></div></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head"><span style="font-size:14pt;font-weight:bold">Methodology</span></span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>As has already been mentioned, this is a strictly empirical study which attempts to verify the findings of earlier research through a computational approach.

It is not likely that a single model will be able to predict Shakespeare’s original choice of <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> or <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span> based on linguistic and extra-linguistic features, because this choice is dependent on so many factors. However, the application of literature, sociolinguistics, pragmatics and conversation analysis all combined into a computational model will be able to successfully predict the pronoun choice as it includes all the factors that might influence the choice for either <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> or <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span>.</p><ol><li class="item">The features of social status, age and sentiment will be better predictors of the pronoun choice than other features.</li></ol><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>A hierarchy will be established according to which the linguistic and extra-linguistic features are predicting the pronoun choice in the best performing model.

Lastly, the support vector machine works with both dependent and independent features. I expect the set of features that will be included in the final model to be a combination of both dependent and independent features, and therefore the support vector machine algorithm to perform best. The three algorithms will be discussed in more detail later in the chapter Classification based on three algorithms.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.2"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.2. </span><span class="head"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Data</span></span></h3><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The data for this study comes from the <span style="font-style:italic">Encyclopaedia of Shakespeare’s Language</span> project<span id="ftn2_return"><a class="notelink" title="More information on this project, which is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AH/N002415/1), can be found on http://wp.lancs.ac.uk/s…" href="#ftn2"><sup>1</sup></a></span>, which is a research project at Lancaster University (UK).

However, some additional annotation was necessary to perform a full analysis of what extra-linguistic features could be predictors of the pronominal address term. The full set of features used in this study can be found in Table 1. The added features are briefly described here.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>As a referent (such as a second person singular pronoun) is dependent on context, the adjacent part of the utterance is used as a feature to test the effect of co-text. Six co-textual words are included, i.e. a 7-gram altogether. “LW” labels the words occurring on the left of the pronoun, and “RW” the words on the right of the pronoun. Each of these words are numbered based on their distance from the pronoun, e.g. LW3 is the third word on the left of the pronoun. In corpus linguistics, collocations are often examined within a three-word-window, meaning there are three words on either side of the word of interest. While I am not necessarily looking at specific collocations of <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span>, the LW/RW features will look at similarities and differences in co-textual words to see if they can predict the pronoun choice.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Another feature noted as critical in prior studies is sentiment, that is the use of the pronoun to convey positivity or negativity. Sentiment was annotated with the use of the 7-gram described above. <span style="font-style:italic">SentiStrength</span> is a lexicon-based sentiment analysis program that scores phrases with a score for positivity and negativity (Thelwall et al. 2010). Since <span style="font-style:italic">SentiStrength</span> was developed to work with online comments rather than complete sentences as in formal written English, it works well with n-grams too. The scores for positivity and negativity are kept as separate variables.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>The corpus already included metadata on the speakers; however, I wanted to include age as well. The age of a character is often not given except for when it is an important attribute of that character, making this difficult to annotate. Therefore, Quennell and Johnson’s (2002) character descriptions were used. The characters were sorted into a trinary classification, with ‘adult’ as the default category. Any deviations towards ‘younger’ or ‘older’ were based on textual references or the character’s name, such as for ‘Old Man’ in <span style="font-style:italic">King Lear</span>. Older characters were occasionally classified as such based on the fact they had adult children with prominent roles in the plays.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>A more global feature is the location where the scene is set. This was difficult to annotate, due to the often unreliable stage directions. Instead of a nominal description for each scene location, I used a binary annotation of ‘public’ and ‘private’. The text itself was examined to determine the location based on what characters said about their location, but in addition Bate and Rasmussen’s (2007) annotation and Greenblatt, Cohen, Howard and Maus’ (1997) annotations were consulted. The use of these three resources enabled the binary manual annotation of location for every scene.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>Besides the information about the speaker and the scene, information regarding the addressee is essential when analysing character interaction from a conversation analysis perspective. As a manual annotation for addressee would be incredibly time consuming, I instead used an automatic method which identifies the previous speaker as the addressee of any given utterance. This is in line with the last-as-next bias used in conversation analysis (Mazeland 2003). This means that, even in larger group conversations, it is often expected that the last speaker before the current speaker will also be the next speaker, thus making it likely that the current speaker is addressing the last speaker. If the utterances were interrupted by the start of a new scene or other stage directions (e.g. someone walking into the scene), the annotated addressee would be the <span style="font-style:italic">next</span> speaker rather than the previous speaker for the first utterance after the interruption.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">7</span>Using the data for the social status of the speaker and the addressee, I also created a status differential. As the status category labels are numeric and ordered, this can be done by taking the difference between the two. For example, a king (status = 0) and a servant (status = 6) are distant in status, and thus will have a high status differential (here: 6). Between a king and a prince (status = 1), the difference is a lot smaller (here: 1). This absolute feature was automatically generated from the already annotated features.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">8</span>A feature that had to be excluded is familiarity between characters (social distance). This data was not already available, and it was beyond the scope of this study to annotate this for all relevant character pairs. The literature has shown this to be a relevant feature. However, through the use of sentiment analysis, I have attempted to cover the complimentary and insulting aspects that could arise from high familiarity, and any lack thereof arising from low familiarity. Obviously, this does not cover all aspects of familiarity, but it means that this feature is not totally neglected.</p></div></div><div class="teidiv1" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.3"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.3. </span><span class="head"><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Classification based on three algorithms</span></span></h3><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Three different algorithms are used for the classification task, namely Naive Bayes, decision trees and support vector machines.

The number of instances of <span style="font-style:italic">you/thou/thee</span> that were extracted from each play range from 363 (in <span style="font-style:italic">Macbeth</span>) to 811 (in <span style="font-style:italic">Coriolanus</span>).</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>I attempted to improve or maintain the scores while making the model simpler by excluding features, that is, through feature ablation. When there were conflicting changes in the scores, the scores of precision and F-measure were prioritised. I hoped to identify which features truly help predict the pronoun by building the simplest but best performing model. The baseline that the models were compared to is derived from the distribution of the pronouns in the dataset, thus 62.6% of <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> and 37.4% <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span>.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>I first took out groups of features that are related, rather than one feature at a time. Among the 23 features, I created six different groups. The first group related to the wider linguistic and social context (play, production date, genre, scene, location), while the second group was the closer linguistic co-text (n-gram). Information on the speaker (name, status, gender, age) and the addressee (name, status, gender, age, number of people) were groups 3 and 4. I kept status differential on its own, because it relates to multiple groups. Finally, the last group was sentiment (positive and negative). After the group ablation, I went back over the features to see if individual feature exclusions would improve the model further. This ensured the simplest and best model for each algorithm. The scores and the features included in each model are given in Tables 2, 3 and 4.</p></div></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head"><span style="font-size:14pt;font-weight:bold">Results</span></span></h2><div class="teidiv1" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.1. </span></h3><p style="text-align:center;"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Trinary classification scores</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Table 2 shows the results of the trinary classification.

Looking at the second person singular pronoun choice as a binary and a trinary classification problem resulted in slightly different outcomes. Even though the highest scores were achieved in the binary classification, one might still wonder whether this is the best method for addressing the second person singular pronoun choice. Looking back at prior studies on pronoun interpretation and comparing them to the features used in this study, we can conclude that <span style="font-style:italic">thee</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">thou</span> are equal in their opposition to <span style="font-style:italic">you</span>, with the main difference being their grammatical role. From the model comparison, we have seen that the co-text is most important when predicting the pronoun. This is evidence of the purely grammatical difference between <span style="font-style:italic">thou</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">thee</span> and their overall similarity in other aspects. Therefore, both linguistically and computationally, it makes more sense to perform a binary classification.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Differences between the algorithms were observed, but all three algorithms easily outperformed the baseline. The support vector machine models performed best, but the scores for the Naive Bayes models were quite similar to those for the SVM models. A choice between these approaches could be based solely on the scores for accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure, or also by taking into account the complexity, which is significantly higher for the support vector machine models. The more nuanced models that the support vector machine creates, which include more features than the models of the other algorithms, may suggest that the extra complexity of SVM models is indeed beneficial.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>The best predicting features were the LW and RW features, which supports the importance of the direct linguistic co-text. In particular RW1 appeared as the most important feature in predicting the second person singular pronominal address term. Other important features were the speaker’s name, addressee’s name, status differential, positive sentiment and negative sentiment, with additional support from the speaker’s gender, addressee’s status, addressee’s age, speaker’s age, and number of people addressed. Only six features were not included in any of the models: genre, play, production date, location, speaker’s status and addressee’s gender.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>I am, therefore, now able to falsify the null-hypothesis that it is not possible to build a reliable prediction model based on linguistic and extra-linguistic features. All six models demonstrate that linguistic and extra-linguistic features substantially<span class="annotation_reference"><span style="font-size:12pt">im</span></span>prove the prediction of the pronominal address term, as all six outperform the baseline.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>The second hypothesis, about which features would be good predictors, was partially correct in predicting that social status, age and sentiment would be included in the best models. However, none of these features were the main predictor of pronoun choice; that was the immediate co-text.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>With regard to the final hypothesis, it has been revealed that the features are indeed both dependent on and independent of each other. However, since the Naive Bayes models perform almost identically to the support vector machine models, we can say that the features are, for the most part, independent of one another.</p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.6"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head"><span style="font-size:14pt;font-weight:bold">Conclusions</span></span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The primary finding of this study is that it is indeed possible to build a prediction model for the use of <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> versus <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span> with a singular referent in the plays of Shakespeare that is based on linguistic and extra-linguistic features. Moreover, in particular, the direct linguistic co-text of the second person singular pronoun is important. Other important features include the speaker’s and addressee’s names, status differential and both positive and negative sentiment. All in all this suggests that the pronoun choice is influenced by several linguistic and extra-linguistic features.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The best scoring algorithm and model was the support vector machine with 87.3% accuracy through its binary classification model.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>For future research, I would recommend an exploration of other algorithms and features that were left out of this study, such as morphology, word embeddings and POS-tags. This will help us gain more information about the linguistic co-text directly surrounding the second person singular pronoun, which will likely give more insight into why this direct co-text is so important in deciding the choice of <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> or <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span>. Moreover, including familiarity between characters (social distance) as a feature would be beneficial, as this has been noted multiple times in prior research as an influential factor, but was beyond the scope of this study.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Although this study has not yet provided a comprehensive set of all the linguistic and extra-linguistic features that influence the second person singular pronoun choice in Shakespeare’s plays, it has definitely provided a more objective and extensive analysis of the matter that furthers the research into <span style="font-variant: small-caps">you</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps">thou</span>.</p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.7"><h2><span class="headingNumber">7. </span><span class="head"><span style="font-size:14pt;font-weight:bold">Acknowledgements</span></span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The research presented in this article was conducted in collaboration with the Encyclopaedia of Shakespeare’s Language project at Lancaster University.

However, the results so far have yet to arrive at an exact and conclusive answer regarding how these pronouns were used. This study combines the strengths of multiple research fields in an effort to determine via hitherto unused computational methods which linguistic and extra-linguistic features influence the second person singular pronoun choices in the plays of Shakespeare. In the English of Shakespeare’s time, the now-archaic distinction between </span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-variant: small-caps">you</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> and </span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-variant: small-caps">thou</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> persisted, and is usually reported as being determined by relative social status and personal closeness of speaker and addressee. However, even between studies with similar outcomes, the results vary massively on the degree of influence and by the inclusion or exclusion of a wide range of other potential influencing factors. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether statistical machine learning will support this traditional explanation.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span><span style="font-size:10pt">In this study, 23 linguistic and extra-linguistic features are investigated, having been selected from multiple linguistic areas, such as pragmatics, sociolinguistics and conversation analysis. The three algorithms used, Naive Bayes, decision tree and support vector machine, are selected as illustrative of a range of possible models in light of their contrasting assumptions and learning biases. Two predictions are performed, firstly on a binary (</span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-variant: small-caps">you</span><span style="font-size:10pt">/</span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-variant: small-caps">thou</span><span style="font-size:10pt">) distinction and then on a trinary (</span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">you</span><span style="font-size:10pt">/</span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">thou</span><span style="font-size:10pt">/</span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">thee</span><span style="font-size:10pt">) distinction, giving six final models to compare. This is a strictly empirical study, which attempts to verify the findings of earlier research through a computational approach. Its aim and main focus is to try and find a pattern or model that best explains the use of second person singular pronominal address terms in Shakespeare, rather than simply achieve the best performing model.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span><span style="font-size:10pt">	The primary finding of this study is that it is indeed possible to build a prediction model for the use of singular second person pronouns in the plays of Shakespeare based on linguistic and extra-linguistic features.

Several other features are also influencing the pronoun prediction, including the names of the speaker and addressee, the status differential, and positive and negative sentiment. Additionally, all three algorithms easily outperformed the baseline. Out of the three algorithms, the support vector machine models score best.

Zato je z jezikoslovnega in računalniškega stališča najbolj smiselna uporaba binarne klasifikacije.</span></p></div><!--Notes in [TEI]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Opombe</div><div class="note" id="ftn1"><span class="noteLabel">* </span><div class="noteBody"> <span style="font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold">ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science, Lancaster University, Faculty of ICT, University of Malta, Faculty of Arts, University of Groningen, </span><a class="link_ref" href="mailto:isoldevd@hotmail.com"><span style="font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold">isoldevd@hotmail.com</span></a></div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn1_return">↵</a></div><div class="note" id="ftn2"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><div class="noteBody"><span style="font-size:10pt"> More information on this project, which is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AH/N002415/1), can be found on </span><a class="link_ref" href="http://wp.lancs.ac.uk/shakespearelang/"><span style="font-size:10pt">http://wp.lancs.ac.uk/shakespearelang/</span></a><span style="font-size:10pt">.</span></div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn2_return">↵</a></div><div class="note" id="ftn3"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><div class="noteBody"><span style="font-size:10pt">CQPweb Main Page,</span> <a class="link_ref" href="http://cqpweb.lancs.ac.uk"><span style="font-size:10pt">http://cqpweb.lancs.ac.uk</span></a><span style="font-size:10pt">.</span></div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn3_return">↵</a></div><div class="note" id="ftn4"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><div class="noteBody"><span style="font-size:10pt"> Weka 3 - Data Mining with Open Source Machine Learning Software in Java, </span><a class="link_ref" href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/"><span style="font-size:10pt">http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/</span></a><span style="font-size:10pt">.</span></div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn4_return">↵</a></div><div class="note" id="ftn5"><span class="noteLabel">4. </span><div class="noteBody"><span style="font-size:10pt"> In Weka, Naive Bayes is identified as NaiveBayesMultinominal, decision tree as J48, and support vector machine as SMO.</span></div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn5_return">↵</a></div></div></body></html>
