                        računskih metod v raziskave, čeprav te postajajo vse bolj priljubljene v
                        družboslovju in humanistiki. Tudi v antropologiji namreč uspešno združujemo
                        kvantitativne in kvalitativne metode, še posebej kadar prehajamo med njimi.

                        »pametne stavbe« uporabili krožne mešane metode, ki prepletajo podatkovno

                <p><hi rend="italic">While social sciences and humanities are increasingly including
                        computational methods in their research, anthropology seems to be lagging
                        behind. But it does not have to be so. Anthropology is able to merge
                        quantitative and qualitative methods successfully, especially when
                        traversing between the two. In the following contribution, we propose a new
                        methodological approach and describe how to engage quantitative methods and
                        data analysis to support ethnographic research. We showcase this methodology
                        with the analysis of sensor data from a University of Ljubljana’s faculty
                        building, where we observed human practices and behaviours of employees
                        during working hours and analysed how they interact with the building and
                        their environment. We applied the proposed circular mixed methods approach
                        that combines data analysis (quantitative approach) with ethnography
                        (qualitative approach) on an example of a “smart building” and empirically
                        identified the main benefits of the new anthropological

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>Social sciences and humanities are rapidly adopting computational approaches and
                    software tools, resulting in an emerging field of digital humanities (<ref
                        target="#Klein.2016">Klein and Gold 2016</ref>) and computational social
                    sciences (<ref>Conte et al. 2012</ref>). Among these is anthropology, which is
                    particularly suitable for traversing between quantitative and qualitative
                    methods. Anthropologists study and analyse human habits, practices, behaviours
                    and cultures, with a particular focus on participant observation and long-term
                    fieldwork as a methodological cornerstone of the discipline. With an increasing
                    availability of data coming from social networks and wearable devices among
                    other sources (<ref target="#Miller.2016">Miller et al. 2016</ref>; <ref
                        target="#Gershenfeld.2014">Gershenfeld and Vasseur 2014</ref>),
                    anthropologists can easier than ever dive into data analysis and study humans
                    and their societies, subcultures and cultures quantitatively as well as
                    qualitatively.</p>
                <p>With this contribution, we tentatively place anthropology in the field of digital
                        humanities,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="1">Anthropology is considered
                        a part of the humanities in the Slovenian academic tradition, while
                        elsewhere it is placed under the umbrella of social sciences. In reality, it
                        probably lies at the intersection of both.</note> mostly because the
                    suggested approach is multidisciplinary and by analogy similar to the shifts
                    between distant and close reading (<ref target="#Jänicke.2015">Jänicke et al.
                        2015</ref>) in literary studies. Just like distant reading can offer an
                    abstract (over)view of the corpus, quantitative analyses can give a researcher a
                    broad understanding of the population she is investigating. And just like
                    distant reading needs close reading to understand the style, themes, and subtle
                    meanings of a literary work, so does data analysis need an ethnographic approach
                    to contextualize the information and extract subtle meanings of individual human
                    experience.</p>
                <p>As <ref target="#Pink.2017">Pink et al. (2017)</ref> suggest, there is value in
                    investigating everyday data that reveal what is ordinary, what extraordinary and
                    how to contextualize the two. In this contribution we expand the idea by
                    employing the <hi rend="italic">circular mixed methods</hi> approach that
                    combines qualitative research from anthropology and quantitative analysis from
                    data mining. We consider the mixed methods (<ref target="#Creswell.2007"
                        >Creswell and Clark 2007</ref>; <ref target="#Teddlie.2009">Teddlie and
                        Tashakkori 2009</ref>) as an integrative research that merges data
                    collection, methods of research and philosophical issues from both quantitative
                    and qualitative research paradigms into a singular framework (<ref
                        target="#Johnson.2007">Johnson et al. 2007</ref>). We also stress the need
                    for a circular research design, where we traverse between methods to continually
                    verify and enhance knowledge. Circularity gives research flexibility and enables
                    shifting perspectives in response to new information.</p>
                <p>Our study, which provides the basis for this article, began in October 2017 and
                    includes 14 offices at one of the University of Ljubljana’s faculty buildings.
                    The building is equipped with automation systems and sensors measuring large
                    amounts of data related mostly to the building’s energy performance and thermal
                    comfort. We retrieved measurements from approximately 20 sensors from the SCADA
                    monitoring system for the year 2016 and extrapolated behavioural patterns for
                    different rooms and, more generally, room types through data visualization and
                    exploratory analysis. The analysis showed specific patterns emerging in several
                    rooms; we noticed there were some definite outliers in terms of working hours
                    and room interaction.</p>
                <p>We used computational methods to gauge new perspectives on human behaviour and
                    invoke potentially relevant hypotheses. Data analysis provided several distinct
                    patterns of behaviour and defined the baseline for workspace use. However, this
                    approach was unable to provide us with a context for the data. Quantitative
                    methods can easily answer the ‘what’, ‘where’ and ‘when’ type of questions, but
                    struggle with the ‘why’. At that stage, we employed anthropological fieldwork
                    and ethnography as the main methods of anthropology. We conducted interviews
                    with room occupants to explain what the uncovered patterns mean and why people
                    behave the way they do.</p>
                <p>The main purpose of our study was to demonstrate how anthropologists can use
                    statistics and data visualisation to establish the essential facts of the
                    observed phenomena and how the traditional anthropological methods, which have
                    not significantly changed since the early 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                    century, when <ref target="#Malinowski.">Malinowski (2002 [1922])</ref> carried
                    out his ground-breaking ethnographic research at the Trobriand Islands, can be
                    complemented and upgraded by data analysis. We call this a circular mixed
                    methods approach, where circular implies continual traversing between
                    qualitative and quantitative methods, between fieldwork and data analysis. Our
                    research applies the proposed methodology to sensor data obtained from a smart
                    building and with a combination of data mining and ethnographic field
                    establishes both a wide and deep understanding of human behaviour in a workplace
                    setting.</p>
                <p>While inclusion of domain experts is already a postulate in machine learning and
                    data mining, the opposite, the inclusion of machine learning and data mining in
                    anthropology, is fairly new and lacks sufficient practical application.
                    Concurrently, few anthropologists and even social scientists and humanists in
                    general are included in the development of AI solutions and data analysis, even
                    when the data is strictly coming from a social domain (<ref target="#Skeem.2016"
                        >Skeem and Lowenkamp 2016</ref>; <ref target="#Lum.2016">Lum and Isaac
                        2016</ref>; see also <ref target="#Pretnar.2019">Pretnar and Robnik-Šikonja
                        2019</ref>). Moreover, the plot twist in anthropology comes from the fact
                    that anthropologists do not act as domain experts explaining the data, but as
                    channels and interpreters for the people to explain the data they produced
                    themselves. In anthropology, authority does not come from the researcher, but
                    from the researched – the group of people that are the source of data and
                    information.</p>

                <p>While digital humanities became a full-fledged field in the last couple of
                    decades (<ref target="#Hockey.2004">Hockey 2004</ref>), anthropology seems to be
                    lagging behind. Some authors suggest anthropology should be more concerned with
                    digital as an object of analysis rather than as a tool (<ref
                        target="#Svensson.2010">Svensson 2010</ref>). However, there have been
                    several attempts to include computational methods and quantitative analyses into
                    anthropological research. Already in the 1960s, anthropologists looked at using
                    computers for the organisation of anthropological data and field notes (<ref
                        target="#Kuzara.1966">Kuzara et al. 1966</ref>; <ref
                        target="#Podolefsky.1983">Podolefsky and McCarty 1983</ref>) and started
                    using computers for social network analysis (<ref target="#Mitchell.1974"
                        >Mitchell 1974</ref>). Progress in text analysis, coding facts, and
                    comparative studies in linguistics (<ref target="#Dobbert.1984">Dobbert et al.
                        1984</ref>; <ref target="#White.1988">White and Truex 1988</ref>) followed
                    suit.</p>
                <p>However, only lately has there been a significant computational breakthrough in
                    the discipline. Digital anthropology turned disciplinary attention to the
                    analysis of online worlds, virtual identities, and human relationships with
                    technology. For example, <ref target="#Bell.2006">Bell (2006)</ref> gave a
                    cultural interpretation of the use of ICTs in South and Southeast Asia, <ref
                        target="#Boellstorff.2015">Boellstorff (2015)</ref> investigated online
                    worlds in the Second Life, <ref target="#Nardi.2010">Nardi (2010)</ref> explored
                    gaming behaviour of the World of Warcraft, and <ref target="#Bonilla.2015"
                        >Bonilla and Rosa (2015)</ref> described how to use hashtags for
                    ethnographic research. Moreover, a discussion has been opened on what does ‘big
                    data’ mean for social sciences and how to ethically address its retrieval and
                    analysis (<ref target="#boyd.2012">Boyd and Crawford 2012</ref>; <ref
                        target="#Mittelstadt.2016">Mittelstadt et al. 2016</ref>).</p>
                <p>There was a discussion on the methodological front as well. <ref
                        target="#Anderson.2009">Anderson et al. (2009)</ref> argue for a method that
                    combines the ethos of ethnography with database mining techniques, something the
                    authors call ‘ethno-mining’. Similarly, <ref target="#Blok.2014">Blok and
                        Pedersen (2014)</ref> look at the intersection of ‘big’ and ‘small’ data to
                    produce ‘thick’ data and include research subjects as co-producers of knowledge
                    about themselves (see also <ref target="#Hsu.2014">Hsu 2014</ref>). Finally,
                        <ref target="#Krieg.2017">Krieg et al. (2017)</ref> not only elaborate on
                    the usefulness of algorithms for ethnographic fieldwork, but also show in detail
                    how to conduct such research in an example of online reports of drug
                    experiences.</p>

                <head>Anthropology vs. Data Analysis</head>
                <p>For an anthropologist, statistical and computational analysis is not the first
                    thing that comes to mind when developing research design and methodology.
                    Anthropologists are trained to observe phenomena in the field, talk to people,
                    spend time with them, participate in daily activities, and immerse themselves in
                    research topics (<ref target="#Kawulich.2005">Kawulich 2005</ref>; <ref
                        target="#Marcus.2007">Marcus 2007</ref>). This type of information gives us
                    detailed stories of human lives, uncovers meanings behind rituals, habits,
                    languages, and relationships, and provides a coherent explanation of the
                    researched phenomena. So why would anthropologists even have to include data
                    analysis in their studies? Why and when is such an approach relevant?</p>
                <p>Sometimes, the phenomena that anthropologists are trying to explain occur in
                    different places at the same time and are impossible to observe simultaneously.
                    It could be that anthropologists know little of the topic they are exploring and
                    have yet to generate their research questions. Alternatively, the nature of the
                    phenomenon lends itself nicely to computational analysis. For example, behaviour
                    of many individuals is difficult to observe in real time, especially if we want
                    to observe them at once in different locations. Sensors, on the other hand, can
                    track behaviours of these individuals independently (<ref target="#Patel.2012"
                        >Patel et al. 2012</ref>) and therefore enable a detailed comparative
                    analysis. With a large number of measurements, researchers can also observe
                    seasonal variations, similarity of users, and changes through time.</p>
                <p>Data analysis also helps us define the parameters of a research field and
                    establish what is ordinary and what extraordinary behaviour. Visualisations in
                    particular are excellent tools for exploring and understanding frequent patterns
                    of behaviour and outliers. When done well, visualisations harness the perceptual
                    abilities of humans to provide visual insights into data (<ref
                        target="#Fayyad.2002">Fayyad et al. 2002, 4</ref>). Moreover, they provide a
                    new perspective on a phenomenon and help generate research questions and
                    hypotheses. Once we know how research participants behave (or communicate if we
                    are observing textual documents or establish social ties if we are observing
                    social networks), we can enter the field equipped with knowledge and information
                    to verify and contextualise.</p>
                <p>Finally, large data sets are particularly appropriate for computational analysis.
                    While ‘big data’ became a popular buzzword in data science, anthropologists most
                    likely will not be dealing with millions of data points that can be analysed
                    only with graphics processing units (GPUs). However, even ten thousand
                    observations are too much for a researcher to make sense of. For such data, we
                    need software tools and visualisations, which provide an overview of the
                    phenomenon, plot typical patterns, and enable exploring different
                    sub-populations.</p>

                <head>Data Ethics and Surveillance Technologies</head>
                <p>Computational anthropology does not encompass only methodological approaches for
                    data analysis, epistemological questions on the relationship of human being
                    towards technology, and empirical research with computational methods, but also
                    ethics on data storage, processing, analysis and dissemination. In a broad
                    sense, it includes three axes of ethics, namely the ethics of data, the ethics
                    of algorithms, and ethics of practices (<ref target="#Floridi.2016">Floridi and
                        Taddeo 2016</ref>). In this contribution, we mostly touch upon the final
                    one, the ethics of practices.</p>
                <p>Research ethics, in particular sensitivity to the potential harm a study could
                    elicit, is one of the core questions of anthropology, which is deeply immersed
                    in the personal human experience. First, a solid deontological paradigm is
                    crucial for working with not only sensitive data but any human-produced data. In
                    this sense, we follow the principles of positivist ethics which call for human
                    dignity, autonomy, protection, maximizing benefits and minimizing harm, respect,
                    and justice (<ref target="#Markham.2012">Markham et al. 2012</ref>; <ref
                        target="#Halford.2017">Halford 2017</ref>). In other words, anthropologists
                    should act in the best interest of the research participants and avoid or
                    minimize negative effects the study could have on the people.</p>
                <p>Secondly, anthropologists should be mindful of the potential subjectivity of
                    their interpretation of the data. Every data set, whether quantitative or
                    qualitative, elicits interpretation that inevitably stems from our own
                    world-view. To keep the bias to a minimum, the suggested circular mixed methods
                    approach, proposed in this article, as well as most others approaches with
                    origins in anthropology strive for continual reinterpretation of the results
                    within the actual social context of research participants. Each ethnographic
                    layer explains the results from the point of view of data producers and thus
                    minimizes the chance of bias and misinterpretation.</p>
                <p>Sensors and wearable devices inevitably invoke questions of surveillance and
                    privacy. Here, we propose a distinction between surveillance and monitoring.
                    Surveillance implies guiding actions of surveilled subjects, while monitoring
                    proposes a more passive stance of observing behaviour (see <ref
                        target="#Marx.2002">Marx 2002</ref>; <ref target="#Nolan.2018">Nolan
                        2018</ref>). The present study was not designed to guide behaviour but to
                    observe and understand, hence being more monitoring than surveillance focused.
                    And even if we consider it surveillance-like, Marx proposes “a broad comparative
                    measure of surveillance slack which considers the extent to which a technology
                    is applied, rather than the absolute amount of surveillance” (<ref
                        target="#Marx.2002">Marx 2002</ref>), meaning that the extent to which
                    surveillance is harmful is the power it holds for the user. The case of sensor
                    data of a smart building that monitors only neutral human behaviour, falls to
                    the soft side of power, which, in the opinion of the authors, deserves some
                    surveillance slack. Nevertheless, we strived to uphold high ethical standards
                    for handling the data and disseminating the results, mostly by employing
                    “ongoing consensual decision-making” (<ref target="#Ramos.1989">Ramos
                    1989</ref>) by informing participants of the purpose of the research, which data
                    are being collected and how the findings are going to be presented.</p>

                <head>Circular Mixed Methods</head>
                <p>Circularity in machine learning and data mining is not a novel idea. Data science
                    methodology already includes ideas about circular phases of data mining
                    (CRISP-DM, <ref target="#Shearer.2000">Shearer 2000</ref>), where phases are
                    interdependent and by reiterating through them the analyst clarifies existing
                    and generates new business questions. However, not much has been written yet
                    alone put to practice in terms of interdisciplinary circularity and the
                    intertwining of methods from different scientific fields (for some pioneering
                    efforts see above).</p>
                <p>For the purpose of our study, we designed a novel methodological approach, named
                    it <hi rend="italic">circular mixed methods</hi>, and employed it to analyse the
                    workspace behaviour and practices of employees. This approach aims to observe
                    the phenomenon from several different perspectives. Nominally, we have split
                    these perspectives into several research stages, where we use a single method,
                    but in reality these methods are used interchangeably and in accordance with
                    each particular situation. For the sake of clarity, however, we will refer to
                    the four stages of research.</p>
                <p>The first stage involved gathering historical longitudinal data from the
                    building’s sensors. We used unsupervised data mining and exploratory data
                    analysis to uncover behavioural patterns, identify interesting individuals
                    (outliers) and form several hypotheses about the use of spaces and energy
                    consumption in the building.</p>
                <p>The second stage involved in-depth ethnographic research, where we used
                    interviews, questionnaires, focus groups, and, most importantly, participant
                    observation from a three-year period of working in the mentioned building. This
                    part helped us clarify the context of particular behaviours, identified the
                    values, motivations and deterring factors of each research participant, and
                    confirmed or rejected hypotheses.</p>
                <p>In the third stage, which is currently in process, we use text mining methods on
                    interview transcripts to find common topics, observe sentiment towards
                    particular issues, and determine which individuals have similar opinions on
                    certain topics. This is still a work-in-progress and the results might even be
                    negative – since this is the first application of text mining on ethnographic
                    interview transcripts, we still need to estimate the viability of such an
                    approach for anthropology. The size of the corpus in anthropology is normally
                    small and it is entirely possible there is no added value to text mining such
                    data. Finally, we conclude with another round of ethnography, conducting the
                    second round of interviews (normally a year after the first one) and verifying
                    the results from the third stage.</p>
                <p>As mentioned before, the distinction between each particular stage is not always
                    strict. Circular mixed methods aim to provide the researcher with the freedom
                    she needs to address complex phenomena from several different perspectives.
                    There can be several alternating stages, where each stage contributes another
                    interpretative layer to the previously established facts.</p>
                <p>There are plenty of benefits of this approach. Circular mixed methods are
                    particularly appropriate for uncovering intricate longitudinal patterns, which
                    are incredibly challenging for the researcher to observe at such granularity.
                    Moreover, this method can be used for observing diachronic phenomena, where the
                    data comes from several locations at once, hence overcoming the physical
                    limitations of a single researcher. Finally, researchers can effectively and
                    rapidly analyse large data collections with computational means. Some such
                    collections are interesting for anthropologists as well, namely social media,
                    archival data, wearables, sensors or audio-visual recordings. Visualisations,
                    one of the product of data mining, substantiate the findings and enable
                    researchers to uncover relations, patterns and outliers in the data. Data
                    analysis can thus help generate hypotheses and questions for the research. This
                    cuts down the time required to get familiar with the field. A researcher can
                    come into the field equipped with potentially interesting hypotheses and test
                    them almost immediately.</p>
                <p>Looking at the data alone, however, we would be unable to determine what any of
                    those patterns and outliers mean. To truly understand them, we need to immerse
                    ourselves in the field, ask questions and observe how people behave and create
                    their habits and practices. While quantitative analysis provides us with clues,
                    qualitative approaches, such as ethnography and fieldwork, explain those clues
                    and substantiate the superficial knowledge of the field acquired in the first
                    and third research phase. Metaphorically speaking, data analysis is great for
                    scratching the surface and ethnography excels at digging deeper. By combining
                    the two approaches, however, we can interpret the data in a rich and meaningful
                    way, as we will show with the case study presented in the article.</p>

                <p>In our study, we have observed sensor measurements from a faculty building which
                    is considered to be a state-of-the-art smart building in Slovenia. Each room in
                    the building is equipped with a temperature sensor and sensors on windows that
                    track when they are open or closed. Doors have electronic key locks that track
                    when the room is occupied. There were altogether 11 sensor measurements, with
                    additional 8 measurements coming from the weather station located on the
                    building’s rooftop. In-room sensor reports the room temperature, set
                    temperature, ventilation speed, daily regime, and so on, while the weather
                    station reports the external temperature, light, rainfall, etc.</p>
                <p>One of the most important measures is the daily regime, which has four values,
                    each representing a state of the overall room setting. When a person is present
                    in the room, the regime is comfort (value = 0) and when a window is open, the
                    regime is off (value = 4). If the room is vacant, the regime goes to night
                    (value = 1) or standby (value = 3).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="2">
                        Standby is activated on workdays as a transitory setting between night and
                        comfort regime.</note> These measurements come from electronic locks on the
                    doors, which record when the room is occupied, and the magnets in windows, which
                    record when the window is open.</p>
                <p>We retrieved 55,456 recordings for 14 rooms of different types, namely 5
                    laboratories, 6 cabinets, and 3 administration rooms. Measurements are recorded
                    bi-hourly and stored in SCADA, a software that allows controlling processes
                    locally or at remote locations, monitoring and processing real-time data,
                    interacting with devices, and recording events into a log file.</p>
                <p>We decided to observe the year 2016 and later compare it to 2017. The results in
                    the paper refer only to 2016. The rooms are anonymised to ensure data privacy
                    and results for two of the rooms are not reported at the request of their

                <p>We performed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing and removed data points
                    with missing values (Table 1). The daily regime was considered the most
                    important variable since it reports a presence in the room or the opening of
                    windows. Concurrently, we retained only the variables reporting the daily
                    regime, since this feature registered human behaviour the best, and room
                    temperature. We also generated additional features, such as the day of the week

                </table>
                <p>In the second part of the analysis, we created a transformed data set where we
                    merged daily readings for a room into one ‘daily behaviour’ vector (Table 2). In
                    the new data set, each room has a daily recording, where the new features are
                    values of the daily regime at each hour. Since sensors only record the state
                    every two hours, we filled missing values with the previously observed state.
                    For example, if the original vector was {0, ?, 0, ?, 1, ?, 1}, we imputed
                    missing values to get {0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1}. As we were interested only in the
                    presence in the room, we put 0 where daily regime was 1 (night) or 3 (standby)
                    and 1 where it was 0 (comfort) or 4 (window open), discarding the information on
                    specific temperature regimes. This gave us the final daily behaviour vector
                    which we could compare in time and between rooms.</p>
                <p>To sum up, we were working with two data sets, the first reporting the presence
                    of people in the room for a given time (11 features from room sensors) and the
                    second one showing the behaviour of the room throughout the day (24 features on
                    room occupancy at each hour).</p>

            <div>
                <head>Results</head>
                <p>First, we wanted to see how rooms differ by room occupancy alone. We hypothesised
                    there will be a significant difference in occupancy between laboratories and
                    cabinets since the presence of more people in a space extends the occupancy
                    hours (no complete overlap of working time). We took the first data set with
                    bi-hourly recordings and removed readings where the daily regime was either 1
                    (night) or 3 (standby) because these readings indicate the room was not
                    occupied. Afterwards, we computed the contingency matrix of room occupancy by
                    the day of the week, which shows how many times per year a room was occupied on
                    a certain day. We visualised the result in a line plot by the type of the room
                    (Figure 1). We can notice that laboratories have a higher presence on Saturday
                    and Sunday than the other rooms.</p>
                <figure>
                    <head>Figure 1: Occupancy of the rooms for each day of the week.</head>

                    <p>Source: Author data displayed in the software Orange.</p>
                </figure>
                <p>Moreover, N and O are the top two rooms by occupancy. We know that these two
                    rooms belong to a single laboratory and are separated with a permanently open
                    door. These two rooms are occupied by the largest number of people and since the
                    employees of the faculty have a somewhat flexible working time, the dispersion
                    of working time is expectedly the highest in rooms with the most occupants
                    (smallest overlap in working time among employees). N and O are also among the
                    few rooms where occupancy goes up towards the end of the week.</p>
                <p>F and B are also laboratories, both displaying similarly high presence across the
                    week. On the bottom of the plot there are cabinets, namely G, K, F.
                    Unsurprisingly, cabinets display lower occupancy rates than laboratories, since
                    cabinets are used by a single person and hence no overlap is possible. They are
                    also functional rooms, used predominantly for meetings, office hours, and other
                    intermittent work of professors.</p>
                <p>With the second room occupancy data set, we made an analysis of behavioural
                    patterns by the time of the day. We observed occupancy by room type in a heat
                    map where 1 (yellow) means presence and 0 (blue) absence. Visualisation in
                    Figure 2 is simplified by merging similar rows with k-means (k=50) and
                    clustering by similarity (Euclidean distance, average linkage, and optimal leaf
                    ordering). Such simplification joins identical or highly similar patterns into
                    one row and rearranges them so that similar rows are put closer together.</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>Clustering revealed that occupancy sequence highly depends on the room type.
                    There were some error data, where sensors recorded presence at unusual hours
                    (for example during the night consistently across all rooms). But despite some
                    noise in our data, we can distinguish between typical laboratory, administration
                    and cabinet behaviour, since our error data constitute a separate cluster (Dave
                    1991). Cabinets again show the lowest occupancy with presence recorded
                    sporadically across the day. Normally, university lecturers spend a large
                    portion of their time in lecture rooms and in their respective laboratories.
                    This is why occupancy of cabinets is so erratic and does not display a
                    consistent pattern. Laboratory occupants, on the other hand, usually come late
                    and stay late, while administration staff work regularly from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00
                    p.m. They both display fairly consistent behaviour.</p>
                <p>We visualised the same data set in a line plot, which shows the frequency of
                    attributes on a line. In this way, we can better observe the differences between
                    individual rooms at each time of the day and where specific peaks (high
                    frequencies) happen. Figure 3 displays the occupancy ratio at a specific time of
                    day, while Figure 4 shows the ratio of window opening.<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn4" n="3">1 would mean the room was always occupied and 0 that the
                        room was never occupied at a specific time of the day.</note> Several
                    interesting observations emerge. In both cases, room O is skewed to the right,
                    meaning its occupants work at late hours and open windows while working.
                    Conversely, room J is skewed to the right, indicating its occupants start work
                    earlier than most. There is also a distinct peak in window opening at around
                    lunch time.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>In most rooms, people are opening windows from late morning to early afternoon.
                    Again, not surprising, considering this is their peak working time. This is a
                    great indicator for an ethnographer if he or she wants to observe windows
                    interaction (who does it, is there a consensus on whether or not it should be
                    opened, does this happen more frequently after lunch...). Looking at the data,
                    the best time for observing the specified behaviour is between 10:00 a.m. and
                    1:00 p.m. Accordingly, data analysis can also serve as a guide for ethnographic
                    fieldwork.</p>

                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>laboratories work more on the weekends,</item>
                    <item>rooms N and O work late,</item>
                    <item>room J starts the day early and opens the windows at lunchtime, and</item>
                    <item>in rooms H, N and O the occupancy goes up towards the end of the
                        week.</item>
                </list>
                <p>How can we explain this? While the data gave us clues, the answers lie with the
                    people. Substantiating analytical findings with fieldwork ethnography is crucial
                    for understanding the data. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the
                    rooms’ occupants to discover what those patterns mean and why a certain
                    behaviour occurs.</p>
                <p>Laboratories have a higher weekend occupancy since they offer a quiet place to
                    work for PhD students who are either catching deadlines for publishing papers or
                    using their ‘off time’ for some in-depth research. Room B, in particular, seems
                    to like working at weekends and we were able to identify an individual who often
                    comes to work on Saturdays. In the interview, he<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5"
                        n="4">For concealing the actual identity of the people participating in the
                        study, the pronoun he is used to denote both males and females.</note> told
                    us this was the time when he finally managed to do some actual work: <hi
                        rend="italic">“Effectively, if you look at the duration of my focus, it is
                        much longer during the weekends. In my opinion, I do a day and a half worth
                        of work during the weekend compared to the weekday.”</hi></p>
                <p>Rooms N and O are quite similar in terms of presence although room N displays a
                    tendency to work the latest. By observing the inhabitants in this room and
                    talking to them, we identified an individual who preferred to work in the late
                    afternoon and evening. Since, as mentioned above, working time is flexible at
                    the studied faculty, he adjusted his working hours to suit his preferences. He
                    also prefers fresh air to artificial ventilation and opens the windows whenever
                    possible. This accounts for the skew to the right for room O in Figure 4. “<hi
                        rend="italic">I like fresh air,”</hi> he told us. <hi rend="italic">“The air
                        outside is always better than the air inside. I opened my window at every
                        chance, even during the winter.”</hi></p>
                <p>The increased productivity in rooms N, O, and H towards the end of the week is
                    explained by the fact that Fridays are working sprints for the occupants of
                    these three rooms. The case of room H is particularly interesting. This is the
                    room with the overall lowest occupancy, yet the room is most frequented on
                    Fridays, unlike in most other rooms, where the occupancy decreases towards the
                    end of the week. Room H is the cabinet of a professor who runs laboratories N
                    and O. He is also a part of the Friday development sprints, hence the peak. Yet
                    he is very sociable and prefers to work in the laboratory with colleagues,
                    rather than alone in the cabinet, as was evident from our observation and
                    discussion with him. This also explains the overall low and erratic occupancy of
                    his room during the rest of the week.</p>
                <p>The skewed peak for room J in Figure 3 is also interesting. The occupant of this
                    room admitted he prefers coming to work earlier to make the most of the day. He
                    stressed several times that daylight is important to him and by shifting working
                    time to earlier hours, he was able to leave early and use the rest of the day
                    for himself. He also said he was the most productive in early mornings since
                    these were the quietest parts of the day. In his words:<hi rend="italic">“[I
                        like coming early] because I have more of the day left in my private life.
                        It is also quiet in the morning and I can do more work.”</hi></p>
                <p>Personal preferences evidently affected the discovered patterns of workday
                    behaviour. In summary, people working in the researched building adjust their
                    working hours and their environment to suit their personal needs, values, and
                    lifestyle. Designing a single solution for such a diverse group not only invokes
                    dissatisfaction among occupants, but leads to lower productivity, higher stress,
                    improvised DIY solutions, and ultimately to higher energy consumption and worse
                    workspace health.</p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>In this paper, we have shown how anthropological (qualitative) research methods
                    can be enriched, upgraded, and substantiated by data analysis. While the
                    findings are still preliminary and based on a limited sample, they nevertheless
                    pinpoint aspects of data analysis that benefit from ethnographic insight and
                    vice versa.</p>
                <p>With the increasing availability of data, especially from sensors, wearable
                    devices, and social media, anthropologists can use computational methods and
                    data analysis to uncover common patterns of human behaviour and pinpoint
                    interesting outliers. Quantitative methods have proven useful when dealing with
                    large data sets. In such cases, an analysis without digital tools is virtually
                    impossible, while visualisations offer new insight into the problem and help
                    present the data concisely. In addition, quantitative approaches also increase
                    the reproducibility of research.</p>
                <p>However, patterns emerging from such analysis can hardly ever be explained with
                    data alone. We argue that data analysis can generate new hypotheses and research
                    questions (<ref target="#Krieg.2017">Krieg et al. 2017</ref>) and provide a
                    general overview of the topic. Conversely, ethnography substantiates analytical
                    findings with the context and story behind the data. Going back and forth, from
                    quantitative to qualitative methods and approaches, enables researchers to
                    establish a research problem as suggested by the data, gauge new perspectives on
                    the known problems, and account for outliers and patterns in the data. Circular
                    research design enhances the quality of information, which does not have to
                    derive solely from a quantitative or qualitative approach. By combining the two,
                    we are using a research loop that ensures both sets of data get an additional
                    perspective – quantitative data are verified with ethnography in the field,
                    while ethnographic data become supported with statistically relevant patterns
                    analysed by computational tools.</p>
                <p>Such methods are already, to a certain extent, employed in digital anthropology
                        (<ref target="#Drazin.2012">Drazin 2012</ref>), but they are gaining more
                    prominence in mainstream anthropology as well (<ref target="#Krieg.2017">Krieg
                        et al. 2017</ref>). By establishing a solid methodological framework for
                    quantitative analyses in relation to qualitative ones, we do not only strengthen
                    the subfield of computational anthropology, but also provide new perspectives
                    and research ventures to anthropology and emphasise its relevance for
                    understanding lifestyles, habits, and practices in data-driven societies.</p>

                <head>Data Mining Workspace Sensors: A New Approach to Anthropology</head>
                <head>Summary</head>
                <p> With an increasing availability of data coming from social networks and wearable
                    devices among other sources, anthropologists can easier than ever dive into data
                    analysis and study humans and their societies, subcultures and cultures
                    quantitatively as well as qualitatively. In this contribution we extend the
                    interdisciplinarity of anthropology by employing circular mixed methods that
                    combine qualitative (ethnographic) approaches with quantitative approaches from
                    data mining and machine learning.</p>
                <p> The research, which is the basis for this contribution, began in October 2017
                    and includes 14 workspaces of one of University of Ljubljana's buildings. For
                    the purpose of our study, we designed a novel methodological approach and named
                    it <hi rend="italic">circular mixed methods</hi>. We employed it to analyse
                    workspace behaviours and practices of employees and to develop sustainable
                    solutions for encouraging a healthy lifestyle.</p>
                <p> As we explain in the contribution, circular mixed methods are appropriate for
                    uncovering detailed longitudinal patterns, which are impossible to detect
                    manually. The suggested approach is effective for analysing diachronic
                    phenomena, where we retrieve the data from several locations at once, thus
                    overcoming the physical limitations of individual researchers. Finally, using
                    this methodology, researchers can effectively and rapidly analyse large data
                    collections. Some such collections are interesting for anthropologists as well,
                    namely social media, archival data, wearables, sensors or audio-visual
                    recordings.</p>
                <p> While quantitative analysis helps us generate hypotheses and uncover patterns in
                    the data, qualitative approaches, such as ethnography and fieldwork, explain
                    those patterns and substantiate data with rich details. Combining the two
                    approaches, we can interpret the data in a contextually rich and
                    anthropologically relevant way.</p>

                <head>Podatkovno rudarjenje senzorjev v delovnem okolju: nov pristop k
                    antropologiji</head>
                <head>Povzetek</head>
                <p> Z vse večjo množico podatkov, pridobljenih, med drugim, z družbenih omrežij in
                    pametnih naprav, lahko antropologi lažje kot kadarkoli prej pri raziskovanju
                    uporabijo podatkovno analitiko in preučujejo ljudi in njihove navade ter kulture
                    in podkulture, in to tako s kvantitativnega kot kvalitativnega vidika. V
                    prispevku razširimo idejo interdisciplinarnosti v antropologiji z uporabo
                    krožnih mešanih metod, ki povezujejo kvalitativne (etnografske) pristope s
                    kvantitativnimi pristopi rudarjenja podatkov in strojnega učenja. </p>
                <p> Raziskava, ki je podlaga pričujočega prispevka, se je začela oktobra 2017 in
                    vključuje 14 delovnih prostorov ene od stavb Univerze v Ljubljani. Za
                    vzpostavljanje novih pogledov na navade ljudi v stavbi in snovanje potencialno
                    relevantnih hipotez smo uporabili <hi rend="italic">krožne mešane metode</hi>, s
                    katerimi smo analizirali vedenje in prakse ter na podlagi le-teh razvili
                    celostne rešitve za spodbujanje zdravega načina življenja in izboljšanje počutja
                    na delovnem mestu.</p>
                <p> Kot pojasni prispevek, so krožne mešane metode najprimernejše za odkrivanje
                    podrobnih in dolgotrajnih vzorcev, ki jih raziskovalec ne more sam opazovati in
                    zaznati. Pristop je učinkovit tudi za opazovanje sočasnih dogodkov, kjer podatke
                    hkrati pridobimo z več lokacij, s čimer presežemo raziskovalčeve fizične
                    omejitve. Poleg tega je metodologija uporabna za učinkovito in hitro analizo
                    velikih podatkovnih zbirk, med katerimi so za antropologe posebej zanimivi
                    podatki z družbenih omrežij, pametnih naprav in senzorjev, avdio-vizualno
                    gradivo ter digitalizirani arhivski viri.</p>
                <p> Medtem ko kvantitativna analiza omogoča postavitev hipotez in odkrivanje vzorcev
                    v podatkih, jih kvalitativne metode, zlasti etnografija in opazovanje na terenu,
                    razložijo in obogatijo s podrobnostmi. Kombinacija obeh pristopov zagotavlja, da
                    podatke interpretiramo na vsebinsko bogat in antropološko relevanten način.</p>
