                    socializem tudi pri upravljanju družbene polemike oz. javnega življenja nasploh
                    izkazoval dvoumnost in nejasnost, ki je bila vzrok mnogim posebnostim tega
                    fenomena v Jugoslaviji. V ozadju Kardeljevega recepta za »družbeno odgovorno
                    kritiko« je bilo leninistično razumevanje demokracije v socializmu, hkrati pa je
                    bil jugoslovanski in slovenski prostor tudi pod vplivom zahodnih liberalnih
                    konceptov. Upoštevajoč politični in ideološki kontekst poznega socializma,
                    prispevek obravnava sistemski način soočanja z družbeno kritiko od konca

                    stanje za kasnejši razvoj demokratizacije. Preden so se v drugi polovici
                    osemdesetih let zgodili veliki družbeni premiki, se je »pluralizem samoupravnih
                    interesov« lahko v praksi artikuliral predvsem na način, da ni bil v kompeticiji
                    s partijskim monopolom. V kolikor pa je do tega prišlo, je vodilna politična
                    garnitura obračun najraje zaupala svojim »pooblaščencem«, sama pa zavzela
                    arbitrarna stališča, prek katerih lahko prepoznamo nekaj ključnih značilnosti
                    poznosocialističnega režima v Sloveniji.</hi></p>

                    Edvard Kardelj’s recipe for “socially responsible criticism,” Yugoslavia and

                    that did not force it into competition with the Party. In those cases when this

            <p>In steering intellectual debates and in the public sphere in general, as in various
                other areas of social life, self-management socialism displayed ambiguities and
                vagueness, giving rise to numerous peculiarities unique to this social phenomenon in
                Yugoslavia that now make it difficult to compare the system or phenomenon with
                situations in central and eastern European ‘real-socialist’ countries. In the
                background of the idea of an organic connection between the social system and the
                engaged intellectual as a predisposition for a “socially responsible criticism,”
                advocated by the leading Yugoslav ideologist, Edvard Kardelj, was essentially the
                Leninist conception of socialist democracy. This country, and its northernmost
                constituent republic of Slovenia in particular, situated at the intersection of
                liberal capitalism and state socialism, bore impacts of exposure to western
                intellectual and political currents, and the dynamics of public controversy were
                strongly correlated to the political (and judicial) culture, clearly distinctive in
                each of the Yugoslav republics.</p>
            <p>Taking into account political oscillations, this article aims at profiling the
                cultural hegemony of self-management socialism between the late 1960s and the
                mid-1980s and ascertaining what this configuration meant for the vigour of the
                public sphere and the later democratisation process. Rather than scrutinising
                concrete forms of individual intellectuals’ engagement,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="1"> For details on the trajectories of
                        different Slovenian intellectuals during socialism see Aleš Gabrič, “Vloga

                        Univerza v Mariboru, 1998), as well as other contributions by the same
                        author.</note> this article is based on an analysis of key theoretical
                texts and political documents in order to present the typology of the regime’s
                classification of social criticism and the ways of dealing with its contents in the
                late socialist republic of Slovenia. The restraint in the use of repressive
                measures, the loose “rules of the game,” which did not require a complete
                identification with the dominant ideology, the open borders, the mechanisms of
                catalysing public debate through the Socialist Alliance of the Working People
                (SAWP), the designation of the League of Communists [of Slovenia] (LC[S]) as the
                bearer of national interests, and a series of other influences led to the fact that
                even during the early 1980s there was neither complete identification nor direct
                opposition to the regime among the greater part of the intelligentsia. It is,
                therefore, difficult to draw a clear line between what was <hi rend="italic">allowed</hi> to write or say in late-socialist Slovenia and what <hi rend="italic">wasn’t</hi>; however, any such attempt at illustrating the limits
                of acceptable social criticism should be taken as a basis for comparing the
                development of intellectual life within Yugoslav as well as central and eastern
                European contexts, and therefore as a prerequisite to the various debates addressed
                by this special issue.</p></div>

            <p>Although all socialist systems shared a common frame of reference, from which the
                leading party groups derived their politics of the day, the dissimilarities between
                these had magnified over the first two decades after WWII to such a degree that
                individual countries could have more in common with other political systems than
                with other socialist countries. The extent of these differences can be appreciated
                particularly in terms of the following key variables: level of economic development,
                type of political culture and mode of communist takeover.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="2"> Chalmers Johnson, “Comparing
                        Communist Nations,” in: <hi rend="italic">Change in Communist Systems</hi>,

                    28.</note> In close connection to these factors, it is also possible to
                trace differences in the phenomena of dissent and opposition, in the importance of
                the integration of critics into society and party circles since the early
                post-Stalinist era. The vigour of social criticism was strongly related to the
                degree of a country’s political dependence on Moscow, to the economic and
                ideological capacity of a regime to preserve the loyalty of its citizens, the
                ability to curb religious communities, the level of cultural interconnectedness and
                openness to the West.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="3">

                comparable factors that had a significant effect during the late-socialist period,
                the political scientist Rudolf Tökés remarked, towards the end of the 1970s, that
                Yugoslavia had always been a peculiarity in this sense, as it solved its internal
                conflicts with methods that significantly reduced (though did not annihilate) the
                potential of the opposition in the country.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="4"> Rudolf L Tökés, “Introduction,” in: <hi rend="italic">Opposition in Eastern Europe</hi>, ed. Rudolf L. Tökés (London and

            <p>The most frequently quoted argument distinguishing between eastern European dissent
                and Yugoslav forms of opposition to the socialist regime is a considerably lower
                level of repression compared to the measures that the critics in ‘real-socialist’
                countries were subjected to, which was particularly evident from the 1960s
                    onwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="5"> Božo

                three conditions necessary for the existence of dissent delineated by sociologist
                Sharon Zukin in the early 1980s {1) public action, 2) criticism of the current
                conditions and their rejection, 3) administrative measures}, so that, to Zukin,
                Yugoslavia was “a model of non-dissent,” as it inspired few statements that could be
                perceived as dissident and even fewer groups that could claim the status of
                    dissidents.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="6"> Jasna

            <p>Before proceeding with an analysis of the status of social criticism in Yugoslavia,
                it is necessary to look at some preconditions that essentially defined its scope and
                significance in the specific Yugoslav environment. First, we should point out the
                “authenticity” of the Communist revolution in Yugoslavia, based on the wartime
                resistance movement under the leadership of the Communist Party, which rose to power
                principally owing to the majority support of the masses and only partially through
                assistance from Soviet troops, as was the case in east-central Europe.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="7"> Jože Pirjevec, <hi rend="italic">Jugoslavija: Nastanek, razvoj ter razpad Karadjordjevićeve
                            in Titove Jugoslavije</hi> (Koper: Lipa, 1995).</note> The National
                Liberation Struggle and revolution became key social integrative factors and an
                integral part of civil religion as an amalgamation of spontaneous and manipulated
                creation in Yugoslavia. At and after the end of the war, much of a potential

            <p>Of particular importance for the handling of the domestic situation was the 1948
                break with the Soviet Union, which made of Yugoslavia a valuable ally of the West.
                According to the Croatian publicist Daniel Ivin, at the triumphant VI Congress of
                the LCY in 1952, the Yugoslav party itself assumed the position of a collective
                dissident, a renegade, although in the belief that it was faithfully following
                Marx’s ideals. Due to its constant interest in preserving a stable multi-ethnic
                Yugoslavia, the West, in most cases, did not cultivate such sympathies for Yugoslav
                dissidents as it did for their east-European contemporaries and denied them the
                support enjoyed by other fighters against Communism.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="9"> Daniel Ivin, “Pojav disidenata u

                problem, as the omission of Yugoslavia from US reports on the implementation of
                human rights protection following the Helsinki Conference or leniency towards the
                host country at the Belgrade follow-up meeting in 1977 clearly demonstrate.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn11" n="10"> Oskar Gruenwald, <hi rend="italic">The Yugoslav Search for Man: Marxist Humanism In

            <p>The most important social prerequisite to reduce the incidence of dissent in the
                Yugoslav socialist system was most certainly a peculiar interpretation of Marxism,
                established after 1948. Among western philosophers and sociologists the opinion
                became consolidated that the Yugoslav system was where socialist humanism was
                particularly well-anchored, and where, accordingly, emphasis was placed on greater
                respect of individual rights and the needs of man as a well-rounded being. The
                underlining of the system’s distinctness from its Soviet counterpart was a sort of
                security valve for a controlled release of criticism of the authoritarian elements
                of ‘real socialism,’ which the self-management system was supposed to have long
                reckoned with. This obsession with “Stalin’s phantom,” which persisted among
                intellectuals for quite some time, distracted Yugoslav critics from searching for
                flaws in their own socialist development.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="11"> Predrag Matvejević, “Samoupravljanje in kulturno

                the very origin of the paradox of Yugoslav self-management, as the philosopher

                joining the self-management process and the regime’s actual fear that its citizens
                would indeed act out Communism, their cynical attitude towards the ruling ideology

                specifically, the possibilities of travelling and working abroad. The resulting
                contacts with the West enabled a more comprehensive understanding of the situation
                there and the related critical distance to the problems of the liberal-capitalist
                system, neo-colonialism, US foreign policy, etc. Also significant, of course, was
                the increased standard of living, of great importance for Yugoslavia, even more so
                than for eastern European countries, and which in the very 1970s reached its highest
                point during the entire period of post-war development.</p>
            <p>The attitude of the Yugoslav political establishment towards social criticism remains
                a very complex issue. In his well-known survey of the main currents of Marxism,
                Leszek Kołakowski pointed out that in Yugoslavia the public word may have enjoyed
                more freedom, but the repressive measures there were just as severe as in other
                socialist countries, and the elements of pluralism in social life could only stretch
                as far as it suited the leading group in the Party.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn16" n="15"> Leszek Kolakovski, <hi rend="italic">Glavni

                terms of personal autonomy and restriction of civil rights Yugoslav intellectuals
                were still much closer to their eastern European peers than to those from western
                liberal democracies. Indeed, the line between the permitted and the prohibited was
                quite blurred and dependent on the current political situation in individual
                republics, and particularly on the personal history of the author of the criticism
                in question. In individuals who put their head on the block it was important whether
                they were members of the League of Communists or former partisans, whether they had
                international connections or enjoyed a good reputation abroad. In fact, the regime
                strived to preserve its image as a liberal system and looked for alternatives to
                harsh repressive measures (e.g., reassignment from teaching to research
                institutions, pressure to move abroad).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn17" n="16"> Dragović-Soso, <hi rend="italic">“Spasioci

            <p>Censorship formally did not exist, but the establishment spread a wide web of formal
                and informal mechanisms with a censoring effect and could, through specific methods,
                also reach outside the state borders, particularly into the environment of the
                Slovene minorities in neighbouring Austria and Italy. Rather than by repressive
                measures, the autonomy of an individual was most often restricted by “friendly” or
                even cautionary conversations, by a system of punishment versus reward, that trapped
                them in the nearly undetectable position of self-censors. Despite the relinquishment
                of some of the most obvious mechanisms of ideological control - e.g., the abolition
                of agitprop following the Cominform rift - the control was maintained through
                boards, faculty councils and editorial offices, where members of regime
                socio-political organisations held the majorities. Outwardly, the autonomy of
                cultural institutions was preserved, but inwardly they were controlled and run by
                the so called Party cells (basic organisations of the League of Communists). This
                was particularly evident in the period of late socialism, when a certain illusion of
                freedom was maintained: the leaders imagining they were not censoring and the
                authors imagining they were not being censored. Within this framework, ironically
                latitude was obtained by the surface adherence to Marxist forms in, for instance,
                introductions and conclusions, camouflaging less conformist philosophical or

            <p>We can draw the general conclusion that in the 1970s, the League of Communists

                activity on the part of the LC, to the assertion of the SAWP as the largest front of
                socialist forces, and to the precedence given to political over administrative
                measures. At the same time, there was already the awareness of the subversive charge

                is no exaggeration to say that in the last decade of Kardelj’s life, the principle

            <div><head>Within Certain Bounds</head>
            <p>“Social criticism cannot be separated from political struggle.”
                With this motto we could sum up the essence of the thought of Kardelj, who,
                believing that social critics are not beyond the objective conditions of struggle
                for socialism, set the key parameters for social criticism in self-management
                socialism. His fundamental work dealing with this aspect of public life, <hi rend="italic">Beležke o naši družbeni kritiki</hi> [Notes on Our Social
                Criticism], which focussed entirely on the treatment of social criticism, was first
                published in 1965 in the magazine <hi rend="italic">Sodobnost</hi>, and then in 1966
                and again in 1985 in the form of a monograph. Essentially, his conceptions of social
                criticism held up until the collapse of the regime, in his later <hi rend="italic">chef d'oeuvre Smeri razvoja političnega sistema socialističnega
                    samoupravljanja</hi> [The Directions of the Development of the Socialist
                Self-Management Political System; 1977], his only additions were evaluations of some
                new phenomena of social criticism that had not been so widespread in the mid-1960s
                (the New Left, in particular).</p>
            <p>It would be wrong to claim that Kardelj was not aware of the
                intrastructural value of social criticism and of the fact that an absence of
                criticism could pave the way to subjectivistic decision-making, bureaucratism and
                even political absolutism.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn31" n="30"> Edvard Kardelj, <hi rend="italic">Beležke o naši

                    54.</note> However, he did not fail to add an essential restriction to this
                relatively open conception of the public sphere: “But socialist society needs
                democracy in socialism, not democracy as a weapon in the fight against
                    socialism.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn32" n="31">

            <p>Kardelj avoided directly prescribing a recipe for what the critical engagement of the
                “progressive” intelligence (a euphemism replacing Lenin’s “honest” intelligence)
                should be, but by pointing out the consequences of public action he succeeded in
                achieving the very norm for an organic link between “progressive” criticism and the
                socialist form. The basic rule was that it should strive for synthesis, for a
                solution of problems arising from the materialistically conceived “objective nature
                of social movements.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn33" n="32"> The notion what ideal Marxist criticism of social
                        practice and theory of the LCY by ideologists and cultural workers
                        themselves should be can be gathered from the concept drawn up for the
                        magazine of the Presidency of the Central Committee of the LCY called
                        ‘Kritika’ (SI AS 1589/IV, b. 324, f. 1745, Okvirni projekat koncepcije

                        3. 1976)).</note> From it society – so Kardelj – did not require
                infallibility, but rather a socialist point of departure and destination.
                Intelligentsia as a class is not automatically the actor of social progress; as a
                reflection of objective processes it can be a projection of the most progressive as
                well as the most reactionary social currents; therefore it should not only clearly
                convey the socio-historical interest of the working class, but transcend the role of
                expert medium and become “the creative subject of advanced social action.” Criticism
                is thus organically linked to socialist progress, from which its “humane”
                responsibility also arises. Distancing, or the “philistinism of clean hands,” is not
                acceptable, nor is critical judgement from the position of ideal (albeit Marxist)
                constructions; criticism should stem from the current social practice without
                becoming a prisoner of “everyday empiricist practice.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn34" n="33"> Kardelj, <hi rend="italic">Beležke</hi>, 22, 56, 69, 85, 93.</note></p>
            <p>With respect to the restriction of the freedom of criticism, Kardelj had no doubt:
                    <hi rend="italic">“</hi>[<hi rend="italic">S</hi>]<hi rend="italic">ince the
                    progressive forces of our socialist society are not neutral, like a speaker in
                    the English Parliament, rather a protagonist of something specific - i.e., of
                    the socialist social movement -it is clear that they cannot be limited solely to
                    the formal defence of the freedom of criticism.”</hi> He allows a democratic
                battle of opinions that are “an organic expression of socialist socioeconomic
                relations,” and not of a “formalist absolute freedom.” Thus, criticism “cannot be
                ‘free,’ just like the political struggle for the restoration of old social relations
                is not ‘free.’” There is no absolute freedom, not even in self-management socialism,
                and in the context of class struggle any instance of criticism is a political act:
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">“Social criticism from the perspectives of historical interests of two classes in diametric opposition is inevitably deeply contrasting. Within such relations any social criticism, however unbiased and strictly scientific or even abstractly theoretical it may seem, automatically becomes, to some degree or another, part of the political practice and therefore shares the fate of the political practice of one class or the other.” </hi>In
                this sense, criticism bears its own responsibility in relation to the effects of its
                action and at the same time determines the level of its own freedom, as the “more
                accountable to the truth and its socialist basis [it becomes], particularly when it
                comes to the fundamental issues of survival and progress of socialist forces,” the
                greater freedom it can enjoy.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn35" n="34"> Kardelj, <hi rend="italic">Beležke</hi>, 41, 45, 49,

            <p> “Responsible” social critics were therefore supposed to draw their own boundaries.
                For those “irresponsible” or even antisystemic critics who started “exploiting
                democratic freedoms” for their political battles, Kardelj saved various
                administrative measures, but advised prudence in their implementation.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn36" n="35"> Kardelj, <hi rend="italic">Beležke</hi>, 48.</note> Unless the constitutional
                order was under threat, which was a quite flexible category, and there was a danger
                of a counterrevolution, the principal Yugoslav ideologist preferred leaning towards
                the “preemptive” political battle, for which he was certain it could compensate for
                repressive measures almost entirely.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn37" n="36"> SI AS 1589 IV, b. 1219, f. 571, Razprava tov. Edvarda

                Still, this was not so much about introducing liberal principles, which Kardelj
                opposed all his life, as it was about a special strategy of settling accounts with
                opponents, which occurred particularly in Slovenia. It was, in fact, a coordinated
                political campaign with the goal of “isolating” ideological opponents, the ability
                to apply differentiation to negative phenomena in society, while administrative

                Acting the part of the primary catalyst of expert as well as general social points
                of view was SAWP. In the context of self-management transformation, it was assigned
                particularly the role of a forum of democratic discussions about concrete pressing
                issues, through which it was to transcend the status of LC transmission and become a

                Communists was (at least partly) relinquishing its political and ideological
                hegemony. The respect of its avant-garde and monopolistic role remained the

                of LC, who were active in the fields of culture, education and research and who “in

                LC policy.” Depending on the degree of opposition expressed against the
                socio-political regime and LC policy they were divided into three groups. The first
                group comprised 51 individuals, for whom it was assumed that sociopolitical
                organisations could “through concrete engagement, animate them to actively
                participate on the SAWP or LCS platforms;” in other words, that they could be
                co-opted into the system’s operation. The second group included 21 individuals “in
                purgatory,” whom the guardians of the regime considered still susceptible to the
                influences of sociopolitical organisations, but requiring further monitoring by the
                SSS. Deemed as “irreclaimable” were “only” four persons, whom the SSS was convinced

                An equally substantial impulse, if not more so, towards the disintegration of
                cultural hegemony of self-management socialism came in the mid-1980s from the
                left-liberal milieu. The circumstance that truly expanded the limits of social
                criticism in the final years of socialism was, in fact, their realisation that the
                distinction between society and state – even a self-management state – could not be
                annulled. A notion of civil society emerged that did not necessarily follow the
                logic of political competition with the LC, but managed, perhaps even more easily
                this way, to introduce into public debate all those topics that had never been

                succeeded in establishing a system that, at least at a normative level, enabled full
                participation in “socialist democracy.” Whereas in fact, in the public sphere that
                social criticism penetrated, he left a series of anchors for the “subjective forces”
                (LC members) to weigh this criticism down, so that it remained faithful to the
                “objective nature of social movements” beating to the pattern of the ossified Party

                participating in joint decision-making. But Kardelj was unable or unwilling to grant
                them majority. He was convinced that they should be led into socialism by the

                the regime, but also with the role of social hegemon that had the right answer to
                all open issues concerning current and future development. Pluralism could only
                reach the areas from which the Party was prepared to withdraw, while
                “self-management” interests could only be articulated in a way that did not put them
                in competition with the Party interests.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn52" n="51"> Höpken, <hi rend="italic">Sozialismus und

                prompted the masses, too, to start questioning the foundations of self-management
                socialism. Until the circumstances matured, intellectuals could not express their
                radical criticism. At least for Slovenia it can be said that the loosening after
                “day X” (Tito’s death) found the critically-prone activists quite well prepared, as
                in the more impervious years they dedicated themselves to actively monitoring the
                situations in the West and East. Armed with the knowledge about newly emerging
                social concepts they could, cautiously at the beginning of the 1980s, then ever more
                assertively, enter the public sphere with their idea of (socialist) civil society
                and claim their share in the process of democratisation.</p></div>

            <head><hi rend="allcaps">The Contours of Social Criticism in Late-Socialist
                Slovenia</hi></head>
            <head>SUMMARY</head>
            <p> Self-management socialism displayed ambiguities and vagueness in handling social
                controversy and public life in general, giving rise to numerous peculiarities
                particular to this social phenomenon in Yugoslavia. While a Leninist interpretation
                of democracy in socialism constituted the background of Edvard Kardelj’s recipe for
                “socially responsible criticism,” Yugoslavia and Slovenia were at the same time
                under the influence of western liberal concepts. Considering the political and
                ideological contexts of late socialism, the article discusses the systemic way of
                dealing with social criticism between the late 1960s and the mid-1980s, while trying
                to determine the impact of these circumstances on the subsequent evolvement of
                democratisation. It is principally based on an analysis of key theoretical texts and
                political documents in order to present the typology of the regime’s classification
                of social criticism and the ways of dealing with its contents in the late socialist
                republic of Slovenia. The restraint in the use of repressive measures, the loose
                “rules of the game,” which did not require a complete identification with the
                dominant ideology, the open borders, the mechanisms of catalysing public debate
                through the Socialist Alliance of the Working People, the designation of the League
                of Communists as the bearer of national interests, and a series of other influences
                led to the fact that even during the early 1980s there was neither complete
                identification nor direct opposition to the regime among the greater part of the
                intelligentsia.</p>
            <p> Despite the official assurance that it was not only necessary, but even
                indispensable, social criticism could not attain the position that it was supposed
                to have within “the pluralism of self-management interests”. The Communist elite in
                power almost never acknowledged that it was justified and constructive, which
                however did not mean that it was entirely indifferent to its demands. In the period
                discussed, social critics could by no means interfere in the League of Communists’
                monopolistic authority or express doubts about the dominant ideological matrix. As a
                result of such self-assurance, communists always treated social criticism as an
                element of political struggle. The extent to which critical demands were taken into
                account usually depended on the argument of power of the critical exponent rather
                than the power of his/her arguments. Prior to the major social shifts of the second
                half of the 1980s, the “pluralism of self-management interests” thus could be
                articulated in practice primarily in a way that did not force it into competition
                with the Party. In those cases when this nevertheless occurred, the leading
                political establishment preferred to leave it to its “proxies” to deal with the
                transgressors, while itself taking on arbitrary positions that displayed some of the
                key features of the late-socialist regime in Slovenia. Well acquainted with the
                situations in the West and East, especially with the knowledge about newly emerging
                social movements Slovenian intellectuals however could, cautiously at the beginning
                of the 1980s, then ever more assertively, enter the public sphere with their idea of
                (socialist) civil society and claim their share in the process of
                democratisation.</p></div>

                Sloveniji</hi></head>
            <head>POVZETEK</head>
            <p> Tako kot na mnogih področjih družbenega življenja je samoupravni socializem tudi pri
                upravljanju družbene polemike oz. javnega življenja nasploh izkazoval dvoumnost in
                nejasnost, ki je bila vzrok mnogim posebnostim tega fenomena v Jugoslaviji. V ozadju
                Kardeljevega recepta za »družbeno odgovorno kritiko« je bilo leninistično
                razumevanje demokracije v socializmu, hkrati pa je bil jugoslovanski in slovenski
                prostor tudi pod vplivom zahodnih liberalnih konceptov. Upoštevajoč politični in
                ideološki kontekst poznega socializma članek obravnava sistemski način soočanja z
                družbeno kritiko od konca šestdesetih do sredine osemdesetih let in ugotavlja,
                kakšen pomen je imelo to stanje za kasnejši razvoj demokratizacije. Razprava na
                osnovi razčlembe ključnih teoretičnih besedil in političnih dokumentov prikazuje
                tipologijo režimskega razvrščanja družbene kritike in načine soočanja z njeno
                vsebino ter njenimi nosilci v socialistični republiki Sloveniji. Zadržanost pri
                uporabi represivnih ukrepov, ohlapna »pravila igre«, ki niso zahtevala popolne
                identifikacije z vladajočo ideologijo, odprtost meja, mehanizmi kataliziranja javne
                polemike skozi Socialistično zvezo delovnega ljudstva, prepoznavanje Zveze
                komunistov kot nosilca nacionalnih interesov in vrsta drugih vzrokov so privedli do
                tega, da še na začetku osemdesetih let pri večini inteligence ne moremo govoriti
                niti o popolni identifikaciji niti o neposredni opoziciji režimu.</p>
            <p> Kljub uradnim zagotovilom o potrebnosti in celo nujnosti družbene kritike, ta ni
                mogla zavzeti pomena, ki naj bi ga imela v »pluralizmu samoupravnih interesov«.
                Vladajoča partijska elita ji ni skorajda v nobenem primeru priznala njene
                upravičenosti in konstruktivnosti, kar pa še ne pomeni, da je bila do njenih zahtev
                povsem ravnodušna. V obravnavanem obdobju družbeni kritiki vsekakor niso smeli
                poseči v oblastni monopol partije in podvomiti v ustaljeno ideološko matrico. Na
                osnovi te zaverovanosti je bila družbena kritika vedno obravnavana kot element
                političnega boja. V kolikšni meri so bile kritične zahteve upoštevane, največkrat ni
                bilo odvisno od moči njenih argumentov, ampak od argumenta moči njenega nosilca.
                Preden so se v drugi polovici osemdesetih let zgodili veliki družbeni premiki, se je
                »pluralizem samoupravnih interesov« lahko torej v praksi artikuliral predvsem na
                način, da ni bil v nasprotju s partijskim monopolom. V kolikor pa je do tega prišlo,
                je vodilna politična garnitura obračun najraje zaupala svojim »pooblaščencem«, sama
                pa zavzela arbitrarna stališča, prek katerih lahko prepoznamo nekaj ključnih
                značilnosti poznosocialističnega režima v Sloveniji. A dobro poznavajoč dogajanje
                tako na Zahodu kot Vzhodu, sploh kar se tiče novih družbenih gibanj, so lahko
                slovenski intelektualci s svojo idejo (socialistične) civilne družbe v začetku
                osemdesetih let sprva previdno, nato pa vedno bolj odločno začeli vstopati v javno
                sfero ter terjati svoj delež pri demokratizaciji.</p></div>
