Namely, the ministry did not appropriately evidence the memos that the scientists were sending.

Samec feared UDBA would send a “provoker” to obtain information on the research, only to use it in a process against him. But Samec already suspected in summer 1949 that UDBA managed to “thrash” one of the employees at the Institute of Chemistry, which he was very offended with.</span> <span id="ftn46_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., 7730, 8013–15." href="#ftn46"><sup>45</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">6</span><span style="font-size:12pt">What worried UDBA was mainly Samec’s poor family situation – health issues of his wife.

In 1950s, the institute’s financial dependence on a single project has proven to be an exceptional challenge for long-term stability. First serious blow was the abolishment of the Federal commission for the progress of production – the main financer of the institute – in autumn 1952 – and employment of the commission’s collaborators at the institute. An even graver blow was introducing a new funding model to the institute: self-maintenance. Until then, the institute received almost all its funds from the state, but now, it had to acquire the resources for its function on the market. By this, the authority wanted to strengthen collaboration of research institutes with the economy, but there was little demand for research favors of the institute. And when projects were acquired, these were tied to performing a specific task. Protests by manager Samec that such a model makes the pure research impossible had no effect. Not even renaming the institute after deceased Boris Kidrič helped.</span> <span id="ftn49_return"><a class="notelink" title="Archives of SASA, Predsedstvo 1953–1963, folder 3, Zapisnik seje predsedstva SAZU (2. 12. 1955)." href="#ftn49"><sup>48</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span><span style="font-size:12pt">Because of the new funding model and slow firing of excess workers, Chemistry Institute found itself in serious financial trouble. First crisis arose in summer 1955, solved by Slovenian government with allocating a research project to the institute. In the next crisis in spring of 1957, Samec suggested introducing social management of his own initiative. He expected that by proposing a management model to authority’s liking, he would gain support of Slovenian authority and additional funds for the institute’s function. To him, it was about finishing begun research before old age debilitation would appear. The government rejected the proposed change due to upcoming passing of legislation on scientific institutions, allocated the institute bridging funds and procured economic orders.</span><span id="ftn50_return"><a class="notelink" title="Oset, “Kemični inštitut (Borisa Kidriča),” 188–92." href="#ftn50"><sup>49</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span><span style="font-size:12pt">In autumn 1957, the republic Act on scientific institutions was passed, and in December 1958 a new decree stating that SASA, University of Ljubljana and Executive council of People’s Republic of Slovenia were cofounders of the Institute of Chemistry Boris Kidrič.

Because of defending strict academic standards and insisting on an outdated code of behavior, favoring some members at his institute, as well as modest job opportunities for young graduates, he fell out of favor with some of his younger colleagues, among them such who would become decision-makers after World War II.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span><span style="font-size:12pt">At the post-war purge at the Ljubljana University, he was detached, removing his habilitation, but as an irreplaceable scientist, he was awarded opportunity to restart his career. Samec had two main goals: perform research and educate young generation of chemists. His was granted substantial amount of funds upon presentation of politically desirable research – i.e. the research of the process of making metallurgical coke from domestic coals. He was still allowed to proceed with his research of colloid chemistry but due to the extent of organizational work, tutoring and health issues as well, to a lesser extent.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span><span style="font-size:12pt">Samec successful running of the Institute and encouraging research results gained him public acclaim as a top home scientist and several important awards as well. However, due to the importance of the Institute core research, he was under UDBA surveillance. Samec has suspected surveillance, which was disappointed realization of wariness in his academic honor. Even more, he was disappointed in mid-1950’s upon introducing the new funding model, so-called self-maintenance. Until then, the institute received almost all its funds from the state, but now, it had to acquire the resources for its function on the market. Protests by Samec that such a model makes the essential scientific work impossible had no effect. Not even renaming the institute after deceased Boris Kidrič helped.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span><span style="font-size:12pt">The final blow to his academic standard was his retirement from the institute in 1959, which was for him the demolition of the institute. Samec adapted to the post-war system in Slovenian academic community (e.g. in terms of selecting research, preferred organization solutions and funding of research), and was aware of political cliffs and issues that could have been perceived as “sabotage”. Even though his academic standards were out-dated, he tried to live by them, therefore his biggest disappointment of the period after WWII was fumbled collegiality among scientists especially younger one.</span></p></div><!--TEI back--><h1>Sources and Literature</h1><div class="listhead">Archival Sources:</div><ul><li class="item">SI AS, Archives of the Republic Slovenia:<ul><li class="item">SI AS 223, Vlada SRS.</li><li class="item">SI AS 1931, Republiški sekretariat za notranje zadeve RSNZ.</li></ul></li><li class="item">SASA, Archives of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts:<ul><li class="item">SASA, Kemijski inštitut.</li><li class="item">SASA, Predsedstvo SAZU.</li><li class="item">SASA, Razna pošta.</li></ul></li><li class="item">Archives’ of family Peterlin:<ul><li class="item">Archives’ of family Peterlin, Notes of Anton Peterlin.</li></ul></li><li class="item">Library of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts.</li></ul><div class="listhead">Literature:</div><ul class="listBibl"><li id="index.xml-bibl-d30e692"><div class="biblfree"><span style="font-size:10pt">Bernik, France. “Iz zgodovine SAZU.” In: </span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Letopis Slovenske akademije znanosti in umetnosti: 46. knjiga: 1995,</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> 147–50.

Upon intervention from the Slovenian communist government, Samec (and his wife) was allowed to stay in Ljubljana as an irreplaceable scientist.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span><span style="font-size:12pt">The Slovenian Prime Minister, Boris Kirdič, offered Samec to establish a new chemical institute within the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. New institute should research (primarily the production of metallurgical coal from Yugoslavian coals) and at the same time trained new, younger generation of researchers. Samec accepted the challenge in the new era that was marked by more assertive role of the state in academia, new rules of decision-making, lesser autonomy in determine research questions, and limitations and collaboration abroad. Even though Samec acknowledge new rules, he was still trying to enforce his personal academic standards. Due to his success, he was awarded public awards and honors as early as in 1949, moreover, he was promoted as role model for excellence and patriotism.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span><span style="font-size:12pt">In 1959, he was retired during a reform in the academia thus a special chemical cabinet was established for him within the framework of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

Samcu in njegovi ženi je grozila izselitev iz Jugoslavije v Avstrijo v skupini Volskdeutscherjev, vendar sta bila umaknjena s seznama po intervenciji slovenske vlade.

Samec je sprejel izziv v dobi, ki jo je zaznamoval večji vpliv države v akademski skupnosti; nove oblike odločanja, manjša avtonomija pri izbiri raziskovalnih vprašanj in omejitve pri mednarodnem sodelovanju. Navkljub spremenjenim pogojem je na inštitutu uvedel stroge akademske standarde. Zaradi svojega uspešnega raziskovalnega dela in vodenja inštituta je že v nekaj letih po drugi svetovni vojni pridobil javna priznanja in nagrade.

Spremembo je sprejel kot izvršeno dejstvo, zato se ni pritoževal, čeprav ga je odstranitev z inštituta osebno prizadela.</span></p></div><!--Notes in [TEI]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Opombe</div><div class="note" id="ftn1"><span class="noteLabel">* </span><div class="noteBody"><span style="font-weight:bold">Assistant Professor, PhD, School of Humanities of the University of Nova Gorica, Vipavska cesta 13, Nova Gorica, </span><a class="link_ref" href="mailto:zeljko.oset@ung.si"><span style="font-weight:bold">zeljko.oset@ung.si</span></a></div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn1_return">↵</a></div><div class="note" id="ftn2"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><div class="noteBody">Aleš Gabrič, “Znanstvena politika v Sloveniji po drugi svetovni vojni in vloga Antona Peterlina,” in: <span style="font-style:italic">Anton Peterlin 1908 – 1993: življenje in delo</span>, eds.

It was then that the legal provision on the authority confirming an academician's election was applied for the first time.
