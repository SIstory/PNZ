            <p> In April 2017 EuParl.net welcomed the Center for Historical Research at the National
                Research University Higher School of Economics St. Petersburg and its director
                Alexander Semyonov in its ranks. On the occasion of this recent membership and the
                numerous upcoming as well as elapsed Revolution centenaries the Center for
                Historical Research hosted an international workshop on »Parliamentarianism and
                Representative Democracy in Crisis of War, Revolution and Collapse of Empires« on
                October 2, 2018, in St. Petersburg.</p>
            <p> As its title implies, the workshop addressed the impact especially of the First
                World War and its aftermath on the development of Parliamentarianism and
                Representative Democracy in Europe. Not less than seven European countries, namely
                Russia, Luxembourg, former Yugoslavia, Germany, Great Britain, Sweden and Finland,
                were addressed. This instance is insofar remarkable as the group of participants was
                small in number due to difficulties in the visa-process. Nonetheless had the
                workshop been fruitful and inspiring and offered the opportunity for interesting
                discussions.</p>
            <p> A brief introduction by Alexander Semyonov and some remarks concerning the network’s
                current work by Jure Gašparič, member of the Board of Directors of EuParl.net,
                opened the meeting.</p>
            <p> In his keynote address, Alexander Semyonov (<hi rend="italic">Higher School of
                    Economics, St. Petersburg</hi>) raised the question, if Parliamentarianism in
                Russia from a historical point of view was and is after all »doomed« or »in crisis«.
                His contribution turned out to be a persuading plea for a more differentiated
                history of Russian Parliamentarianism. »Doomed« thereby referred to a specific
                interpretation of the history of political representation that treats
                Parliamentarianism as naturally short lived and a »non-organic experiment« in
                Russian history, which resulted from the Empires defeat in the Russo-Japanese war
                1905. Autocracy in contrary is claimed to be Russia's »natural political way«. This
                interpretation, which amongst others the American scholar Richard Pipes was empathic
                on, is somewhat a Russian Sonderweg-thesis. It discredits all forms of political
                representation and of constitutional arrangements until this day. Thus its
                continuing popularity amongst Russian historians and the Russian public is for
                Semyonov one major reason for the ongoing crisis of Russian Parliamentarianism.
                Given this impact of the interpretation, Semyonov strongly argued for a new sight on
                the history of political representation, which on the one hand ought to take into
                consideration the emergence of an idea of political representation in the face of
                social and political crisis in 1905/6, that made possible the election of the first
                Russian parliament – the Imperial State Duma. On the other hand this new approach
                should also recognize that the Imperial State Duma was quite successful at its work.
                The bills it passed had for example a strong impact on the modernization of the
                Empire.</p>
            <p> That the failure of Russian Parliamentarianism is not a mere destiny explainable
                through the alleged autocratic nature of Russian politics was also shown by
                Konstantin Tarasov (<hi rend="italic">St. Petersburg Institute of History of the
                    Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg State Electrotechnical University
                    »LETI«</hi>), who emphasized the importance of soldiers organizations and the so
                called »committee class« in the development of the revolutionary process in 1917,
                which finally overthrew not only the monarchy but also the Provisional Government
                and with it Russian Parliamentarianism. Tarasov therefore highlighted the
                fragmentation of the Imperial Army in at least three political groups during the
                February and the October Revolution: first the nobles, who continued supporting the
                tsar, second the »middle-strata-soldiers«, who formed soldiers' committees and
                backed the introduction of a representative democracy respectively the Provisional
                Government and third the »peasant-soldiers« that were in favour of a direct
                democracy because parliamentary representation had failed to address their needs. He
                showed that all of these groups took action and influenced the outcome of the 1917s
                Revolution and thereby shaped Russia’s Parliamentary and democratic history – which
                meant bringing it to an early end. </p>
            <p> Whereas in Russia Parliamentarianism and Representative Democracy 1917 stopped
                being, Pasi Ihalainen (<hi rend="italic">University of Jyväskylä, Finland</hi>)
                diagnosed »Springs of Democracy« both in Britain, Germany, Sweden and Finland during
                the period between 1917 and 1919. His contribution summarized the main results of
                his recently published book of the same title, in which he compared national and
                transnational debates on Constitutional Reforms in the mentioned countries. The
                given analysis, while specifying the common and distinctive features of national
                debates, unravelled the transnational links between the outbreak of the Russian
                Revolution and the gained constitutional compromises of 1918–19 in Britain, Germany,
                Sweden and Finland. The First World War, according to Ihalainen, not only caused a
                simultaneous development of the Reform process in all reviewed countries, but also
                lead to a crisis of political legitimacy in which the Russian Revolution appeared as
                an even bigger threat to the existing orders. Both war and revolution became
                catalysers for more or less enforced constitutional reforms and democratization
                processes, which lead to a redefinition of the concepts »people« and »parliament«
                and to »Springs of democracy«. </p>
            <p> The development Ihalainen outlined also applied to Luxembourg. After the war and
                facing the possibility of a workers‘ uprising, the concept »people«, as showed by
                Renée Wagener (<hi rend="italic">University of Luxembourg</hi>), has been
                politically redefined in the Grand-Duchy. To fortify her point of view she shed a
                light on the process of introducing universal suffrage in Luxembourg from the
                pre-war census to the first workers‘ strikes 1917 until its implementation in
                January 1919. Her primarily analytical focus were parliamentary discussions
                concerning the new constitution and in particular article 52 which determined
                suffrage. When finally adopted in January 1919 the constitution granted suffrage for
                men and women alike. Hence it was not less than a tremendous step of
                democratization, one little drop of bitterness was marring the overall evaluation of
                this development. As a matter of fact it hadn't been conviction or the women's
                influence that finally brought women's suffrage but short-term electoral
                considerations of Luxembourg's Conservative Party, hoping for women's votes to save
                the monarchy. Nevertheless the case of Luxembourg is yet another example how war and
                crisis eventually lead to a strengthening of representative democracy and
                Parliamentarianism.</p>
            <p> Regarding the case of former Yugoslavia, »War, Crisis and Collapse of Empires« in
                contrary marked the starting point of an eventful history of Parliamentarianism in
                the first place. In an original approach Jure Gašparič (<hi rend="italic">Institute
                    of Contemporary History, Slovenia</hi>) analysed the fragility of
                Parliamentarianism and representative democracy in the newly formed multi-ethnic
                state. He showed, that the environment where any parliament holds its session as
                well as its assigned building precondition the self-awareness of its members and
                expert staff. Because of that Parliamentary buildings – and parliaments through it –
                are a means of communication with citizens. Their architectural appearance is not
                only a matter of aesthetic principle, but political convictions as well. In the case
                of Yugoslavia, as Gašparič pointed out, the characteristic of the different
                parliamentary buildings, starting with the Old King Court, followed by the Cavalry
                barracks (1920–1929) up to the Manjež Theatre (1931–36), where it was placed by
                Alexander I to discredit it as a talking shop, showed not only the unsolved national
                question of the multi-ethnic state but also the weakness of democracy itself.
                Nonetheless the construction of a new parliament building started right after the
                founding of Yugoslavia. This was to show the Ottoman Empire as well as the rest of
                the world, that Yugoslavia was an independent state. It wasn't until 1936 that the
                Parliament could move into its own building, the »House of the National Assembly«,
                which until today is the seat of the Serbian parliament. </p>
            <p> The presentation of the panels were followed by a lively discussion that deepened
                the introduced topics and helped sharpening some research approaches. Particularly
                outstanding was yet the possibility of continuing to examine Gašparič's thesis at
                the historical site of Russia's first parliament, which the workshop’s participants
                were offered to visit at the end of the conference. The gained first-hand experience
                and various explanations given by Alexander Semyonov on the »Tauride Palace«, which
                hosted the Imperial State Duma from 1906–1917, verified the correlation between the
                parliamentary environment, the political meaning of Parliamentarianism and the state
                of democracy. Surrounded by the tsar's barracks the Duma could have easily been
                eliminated at any time. Unnecessary to say, that this location expressed another
                Parliament's weakness. </p>
            <p> The excursion to the »Tauride Palace« concluded an informative conference, which put
                current approaches and questions of parliamentary research to the discussion and
                promoted academic exchange across borders.</p>
