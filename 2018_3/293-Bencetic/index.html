As of the second issue, the journal was called the “Istrian Youth Journal” and was financed by the National Youth District Committee, and this status was likely obtained through the party line.

Ljubica Ivezić, the initiator of <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Istarski borac</span>, explained it this way: the students “took on the task of using their literary and cultural work in the first place to fight for the affirmation of their domestic <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">word</span>, which was severely persecuted under the Italian fascism”.<span id="ftn3_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., 97." href="#ftn3"><sup>2</sup></a></span> In the introduction to the first issue of <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Istarski borac</span>, the editorial board explained the reasons for launching the journal: “The authors of original works will find their topics firstly in their personal lives, then in Istrian and Yugoslav socialistic reality. With this kind of work, we will foster a love for the mother tongue, for our socialist country and our people. We will constantly prove to each and every one that the youngest Istrian generations do not want to substitute their beloved native tongue with a foreign one, nor their national government for dominion by foreigners ever again”.<span id="ftn4_return"><a class="notelink" title="Istarski borac (Pula), No. 1 (1953): 1." href="#ftn4"><sup>3</sup></a></span> The journal was intended for young people from elementary school to university students and mostly financed by the Self–management Interest Community (SIC, croatian: Samoupravna interesna zajednica – SIZ) for the culture of the Municipality of Pula.

It is stated that the youth press has a great educational function in “explaining the essence and contradictions in our development, which clearly makes it an active element of the ideological struggle against provincialism (philistinism), bureaucratism, technocracy, nationalism, dogmatism, and other anti-socialist and anti-self-managing tendencies”.<span id="ftn16_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., 3." href="#ftn16"><sup>15</sup></a></span> It is further stated that the youth press is largely focused on the “marginal problems of the society as a whole”, that it often problematizes the “marginal social groups and phenomena” and thus poses a certain “danger in the conceptual sense, not because these phenomena are not worth writing about but because in regards to the real problems, questions, and dilemmas concerning further development of society, these marginal problems are being overemphasized”, thus opening the possibility for the “manipulating anti-self-managing and anti-socialistic forces to misuse it”.<span id="ftn17_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., 4, 5." href="#ftn17"><sup>16</sup></a></span> It was also mentioned that the youth newspapers should distinguish themselves by “engaging and affirming in the revolution”, but how such youth attitude was known to become “a dogma, turn into criticism, leftism, result in incidents, prohibitions, and wrongly highlighted social issues”.<span id="ftn18_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., 3." href="#ftn18"><sup>17</sup></a></span></p><p id="index-p-d46e301"><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>The same document also states that the FR of Croatia had nine youth newspapers in the late 1970s: <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Polet, Studentski list, Val, Laus, Pet, Omladinska iskra, Lok, Ibor</span> and <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Omladinac</span>, all of them having in common unresolved material, personnel and spatial requirements.<span id="ftn19_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., 7." href="#ftn19"><sup>18</sup></a></span></p></section><section class="teidiv0" id="index-body.1_div.3"><header><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head" itemprop="head">Istarski Borac Literary Club and Journal <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Istarski borac</span> / <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span></span></h2></header><p id="index-p-d46e319"><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The Istarski borac Literary Club was the literary section of Pula’s high school students, established in 1953.

Using the deductive approach, starting with the profiling of totalitarian institutions, focusing on psychiatric institutions and their patients, the editorial draws conclusions, referring to eminent historical personalities from the fields of philosophy, historiography and culture, that an artist can only be a person who is either on the border of madness or has already passed that boundary. This is backed up by a series of texts and poems, the most provocative among them being “Please Master” by American poet Allen Ginsberg.

They stated that the “unfortunate Ginsberg is a cause of much casual gossip and labeling of IBOR’s editorial staff from the “filters” of social morality such as A. Č. The civil terms “swear words” and “vulgarities” simply fade away as archaism compared to those as stylemes without which one period of literary creativity is missing in the world and here. It seems that the individuals must be repeatedly reminded of the well-worn statement that the appreciation of the artistic level of a particular literary work is mainly in the domain of poetics, literary criticism and aesthetics, and by no means a tool for political discredit by drawing out of the context of a whole”.<span id="ftn38_return"><a class="notelink" title="IBOR Redaction, “Fusnote za A.

They would have to look at the last page of the <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span>, on which the photo was published showing at best three year old lying prone on the road, surrounded by adults and signed ‘Please Master’. If people in <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> don't know what they have done with it, then they are not up to the job they are doing, because the photograph in the context of the poem ‘Please Master’ by which it is named, undoubtedly puts the innocent child into the center of homosexual lust.

When asked by journalist Vladimir Cvitan: “When it comes to ‘Ibor’ and dismissing its editorial staff, it is generally taken as known that by publishing Ginsberg’s poem ‘Please Master’ a mistake has been made?” Matvejević answered: “I think publishing one somewhat challenging poem of one good poet (a poem that speaks of homosexuality) is more mischief than a mistake.

Given the words of the poem and the photograph which is explicitly related to the poem, it is more than obvious that it is a poem of pedophilic character, while the homosexual part of the poem’s character is probably less important because homosexualism was decriminalized in socialist Yugoslavia in 1977. Armando Černjul referred to an interview with Matvejević in the earlier mentioned article “Enough with crude disinformation”. Černjul stated that Matvejević and journalist Cvitan give inaccurate information about the “IBOR Case” and how they are wrongly informed. Černjul thinks that one of the reasons for Matvejević’s misinformation is the visit of <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span>’s editorial board to Professor Matvejević.<span id="ftn41_return"><a class="notelink" title="Armando Černjul, “Dosta grube dezinformacije,” Polet (Zagreb), February 6, 1980, 2." href="#ftn41"><sup>40</sup></a></span></p><p id="index-p-d46e618"><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Slavko Kalčić and Aldo Monfardin, two members of the last editorial board of <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Istarski Borac/IBOR</span>, published the article “IBOR Case” in the newspaper <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Pitanja</span> in 1980. In the article they respond to the attacks in other newspapers, especially Armando Černjul’s texts and the accusations from the DC ASYC/OK SSOH. As a defense to Černjul’s accusations of vulgarism, and in relation to the poem “Please Master”, they state that Černjul takes the photograph and the poem “out of the context of the issue’s theme (Total institutions), pretending not to understand or indeed not understanding the term <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">literary</span>, simultaneously vulgarizing it and attacking IBOR with low blows using the arsenal of Christian moralism”.<span id="ftn42_return"><a class="notelink" title="Slavko Kalčić and Aldo Monfardin, “Slučaj ‘Ibor,’” Pitanja (Zagreb), No. 3 (1980), 71–77." href="#ftn42"><sup>41</sup></a></span> Answering the accusations from the DC ASYC/OK SSOH (which were published in <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Glas Istre,</span> issue from December 3, 1979), that many articles published in <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> were “not suitable, especially for the age of those the journal was intended for”, the editorial staff relativised these claims and said that such a label could “usually be found on Danish-Swedish film co-productions!”. They focused on the second part of the accusations, which state that part of the inscriptions is unacceptable “as a way of presenting our social reality”. The part about presenting “our social reality” is deemed crucial by <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span>’s editorial board, and they confirm it with Rakočević’s article published in the Istrian edition of <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Večernji list</span> from December 4, 1979. In the article Rakočević accused them of publishing the texts with “views that are foreign to our self-managing and socialist society, impose a destructive approach to the treatment of social topics and problems, and instead of being a forum for young people, <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> increasingly becomes a ground for the nebulous wisdom of individuals.”<span id="ftn43_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., 73." href="#ftn43"><sup>42</sup></a></span> Further in the text, as a sort of conclusion, the authors pointed out that one “poem instead of giving aesthetic and cognitive pleasure resulted in extraordinary sessions, work groups (...) It is wrong, however, to think that the song missed its purpose. On the contrary, it fulfilled it entirely by bringing to light the hereditary illness of a closed community. Instead of a word no one listens to under the dome of deaf indifference, the poem has become the catalyst for the events.”<span id="ftn44_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid." href="#ftn44"><sup>43</sup></a></span> As a key part of their defense in this article, the authors emphasized the “Marxism” of their actions and the fact that “the coupling of sexual and political inhibition” is joined against them: “To speak out about this means to touch into the sacrosanctness of the ‘guardians’ of such activity. We come to an important problem in the whole case: isn’t the ‘freedom of speech’ lower in provincial conditions where the local totems rule, and where political and sexual are not yet free from taboos? It is not by chance that in one particular case sexual and political merge by cause and effect relationship as the initiators and the mechanisms of silencing. Historical analysis of the written/spoken word in relation to these two areas would show that they were, in fact, its limiters in societies without freedom/democracy. Boasting with progressive consciousness is not uncommon in these times, but progressive consciousness is not in Marxist phrases, but in Marxist deeds. We think that <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR’s</span> work is Marxist in its critical, open and argumentative writing.

The <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> was discussed in the party circles even before it became a public case, i.e. prior to publishing the issue 4–5/79 and the poem “Please Master”. At the time <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> was criticized for not giving enough space to young authors, not submitting reports, publishing only a half of planned issues for 1978 and 1979, and dealing primarily with the issues of the Pula commune. After the outbreak of the “<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR </span>Case”, Party’s analysis of the<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi"> IBOR</span> put an emphasis on the non-fulfillment of obligations, the absence of young non-established authors and the ideological turn of the editorial board, which is reflected in improper writing about the Yugoslav self-managing socialist society. The analysis ignored the poem “Please Master” only briefly stating that the last issue of <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> was full of vulgarity. This disregard for content of the last issue gives the impression that the poem “Please Master” was perhaps not the reason why the financing of <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR </span>was cancelled and that the reason lies in the “destructive” writing of some authors – “this approach and a way of writing about our social reality reflects their ideological orientation which is foreign to our self-managing socialist society”.</p><p id="index-p-d46e748"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>On the other hand, the editorial board thought that their writing is critical, but not (culture of dissent) towards Marxism: “We think that <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span>’s work is Marxist in its critical, open and argumentative writing” - but towards negative phenomena in society. Has the <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span>’s editorial board really thought that their activity was Marxist or was it a defense against an attack that would reduce the damage done to <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> and to them as individuals – this remains an open question and is subject to further interpretation.

The <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> was discussed in the party circles even before it became a public case, i.e. prior to publishing the issue 4–5/79 and the poem “Please Master”. At the time <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> was criticized for not giving enough space to young authors, not submitting reports, publishing only a half of planned issues for 1978 and 1979, and dealing primarily with the issues of the Pula commune. After the outbreak of the “<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR </span>Case”, Party’s analysis of the<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi"> IBOR</span> put an emphasis on the non-fulfillment of obligations, the absence of young non-established authors and the ideological turn of the editorial board, which is reflected in improper writing about the Yugoslav self-managing socialist society. The analysis ignored the poem “Please Master” only briefly stating that the last issue of <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> was full of vulgarity. This disregard for content of the last issue gives the impression that the poem “Please Master” was perhaps not the reason why the financing of <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR </span>was cancelled and that the reason lies in the “destructive” writing of some authors – “this approach and a way of writing about our social reality reflects their ideological orientation which is foreign to our self-managing socialist society”.</p><p id="index-p-d46e901"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>On the other hand, the editorial board thought that their writing is critical, but not (culture of dissent) towards Marxism: “We think that <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span>’s work is Marxist in its critical, open and argumentative writing” - but towards negative phenomena in society. Has the <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span>’s editorial board really thought that their activity was Marxist or was it a defense against an attack that would reduce the damage done to <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> and to them as individuals – this remains an open question and is subject to further interpretation. The <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span>’s last editorial board can hardly be denied the courage to write about topics which were taboo and caused discontent in Pula’s conservative surroundings. However, the editorial board was probably aware that the same topics would bring about discontent from the Party and that their actions put them at the limits of tolerance.

Časopis je izdajal Književni klub Istarski borac, in sicer z namenom ohranjanja hrvaškega jezika v Istri kot temeljnim vodilom. V sedemdesetih letih 20. stoletja je časopis prevzel značaj kritičnega medija in postopoma uvajal vse več kulturnih, lokalnih in družbenih tem, katerih ton pa socialistična oblast ni dobro sprejela. Jeseni leta 1979 je izbruhnil »primer IBOR«. Časopisu so istega leta ukinili financiranje, zaradi česar je prenehal izhajati. Povod za ukinitev časopisa je bila sicer pesem z naslovom <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Please, master</span> (hrv.: <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Molim te, učitelju</span>) Allena Ginsberga, toda partijski dokumenti razkrivajo, da je bil razlog političen. Pričujoča razprava poskuša odgovoriti na vprašanje, ali je delovanje zadnjega uredništva časopisa <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Istarski borac</span>/<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> mogoče obravnavati kot kulturo disidentstva.</p><p id="index-p-d46e950"><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>»<span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Primer IBOR</span>« je dokaj zapleten, zato odgovor na vprašanje, ali je pri njem šlo za kulturo disidentstva ali ne, ni preprost. O časopisu <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> so v partijskih krogih razpravljali še pred javnim odprtjem primera oziroma pred izdajo številke 4–5/79 in pesmi <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Please, master</span>. Takrat se je govorilo, da časopis ne daje dovolj prostora mladim avtorjem, da ne oddaja poročil o delu, da je leta 1978 in 1979 objavil pol manj številk, kot je bilo predvideno, in da se ukvarja predvsem s problematiko puljske komune. Po izbruhu »primera <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span>« je v partijski analizi opaziti poudarek na neizpolnjevanju obveznosti, izpustu mladih, še neuveljavljenih avtorjev in idejnem odklonu uredništva, kar naj bi se odražalo v nepravilnem pisanju o jugoslovanski samoupravni socialistični družbi. V analizi je sicer prezrta pesem <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Please, master</span>, pri čemer je zgolj na kratko omenjeno, da je zadnja številka časopisa <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> polna prostaštva. Tovrstno ignoriranje vsebine zadnje številke zbuja vtis, da pesem <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Please, master</span> ni bila razlog za umik financiranja časopisa <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span>. Nakazuje namreč, da je razlog vendarle »destruktivno« pisanje nekaterih avtorjev, saj da »tak pristop in način pisanja o naši družbeni stvarnosti odražata idejno opredelitev, ki ni v skladu z našo samoupravno socialistično družbo«.</p><p id="index-p-d46e977"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Po drugi strani pa je samo uredništvo bilo mnenja, da je njihovo pisanje sicer kritično, vendar ni kritično (culture of dissent) do marksizma: »Menimo, da je delovanje časopisa <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> marksistično po svojem kritično usmerjenem, odprtem in argumentiranem pisanju«, toda kritično naravnano do negativnosti v družbi. Vprašanje o tem, ali je uredništvo časopisa <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> v resnici menilo, da je njihovo delovanje marksistično, ali je šlo zgolj za obrambo pred napadom, s katero so hoteli omiliti škodo, ki so jo utrpeli <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> in člani uredništva kot posamezniki, je ostalo odprto in predmet naknadnih interpretacij. Nikakor pa zadnjemu uredništvu časopisa <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> ne gre oporekati poguma, s katerim so se lotili pisanja o tabu temah, ki so izzvale nezadovoljstvo v konservativnem puljskem okolju. Kljub temu so se njegovi člani najbrž zavedali, da bodo ravno te teme povzročile negodovanje tudi v Partiji in da se s svojim delovanjem pomikajo proti sami meji tolerance. S takim delovanjem je uredništvo revije <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">IBOR</span> pokazalo pogum in se uprlo, če že ne marksizmu, kot so dejali sami, pa gotovo vsaj skupnosti, v kateri so delovali in živeli.</p></section></div><!--Notes in [TEI]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Notes</div><div class="note" id="ftn1"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn1_return"><sup>*</sup></a> <span class="noteBody"><span style="font-weight:bold" itemprop="hi">Research Fellow, PhD, Croatian Institute of History, Opatička 10, 10000–Zagreb, Croatia,</span> <a class="link_ref" itemprop="ref" href="mailto:lidija.bencetic@gmail.com"><span style="font-weight:bold" itemprop="hi">lidija.bencetic@gmail.com</span></a></span></p></div><div class="note" id="ftn2"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn2_return"><sup>1.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">Ljubica Ivezić, “I jedna važna obljetnica između na koju ne treba zaboraviti,” <span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Dometi</span> (Rijeka), No. 5–6 (1992): 95–100.</span></p></div><div class="note" id="ftn3"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn3_return"><sup>2.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">Ibid., 97. </span></p></div><div class="note" id="ftn4"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn4_return"><sup>3.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody"><span style="font-style:italic" itemprop="hi">Istarski borac</span> (Pula), No. 1 (1953): 1.</span></p></div><div class="note" id="ftn5"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn5_return"><sup>4.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody">HR HDA 1220, Savez komunista Hrvatske.
