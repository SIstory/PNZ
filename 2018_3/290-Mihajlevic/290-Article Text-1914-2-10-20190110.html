His case delineates the issue of the Croatian national reform movement known as the Croatian Spring. Due to his solid character he was not afraid to defend his standpoints, even in the fights with communist comrades who were higher in the hierarchy of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which caused his political decline.

He states that, after Vladimir Bakarić left his position as a political commissar of the Main Headquarters of Croatia in 1944, Holjevac was supposed to fill that position. He was the Commissar of the First Corps (the largest formation of the Croatian Partisan Army) and was then a Party member who had most experience as commissar and the one with the best reputation.<span id="ftn24_return"><a class="notelink" title="Goldstein, “Nacrt za Vecinu biografiju,” 621." href="#ftn24"><sup>23</sup></a></span> However, instead of Holjevac, Rade Žigić, former Commissar of the 6<sup>th</sup> (Lika) Division, which was a part of the Corps Holjevac commanded.

Alternatively, perhaps he was skipped because of the national key.

At that time Marijan Stilinović, member of the Executive Committee of the Central Committee of LCC, due to his liberal attitudes was removed from the political leadership and political life.<span id="ftn27_return"><a class="notelink" title="Zdenko Radelić, “Đilasovci u Hrvatskoj i hrvatska historiografija,” in: Disidentstvo u suvremenoj povijesti, eds.

As very few of them, he had succeeded in avoiding the influence of the communist bureaucracy that kills any initiative.”<span id="ftn29_return"><a class="notelink" title="“Iznenadna smrt Većeslava Holjevca,” Nova Hrvatska 12, No. 2-3 (August 1970): 5, 6." href="#ftn29"><sup>28</sup></a></span> In that sense, his conflict with centralist bureaucracy was most important. That bureaucracy was considered an obstacle for Yugoslavia’s progress, especially in Croatia and Slovenia. Many Croatian communists thought Croatia was investing too much in federal funds and the capital of Yugoslavia (Belgrade) while other republic centres were unjustly lagging behind. As a Mayor of Zagreb, Holjevac had shown that it was possible to develop other cities, their industry and infrastructure, despite the opposition of the centralist bureaucracy.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>Moving the Zagreb Fair to a new location was the risky undertaking of Većeslav Holjevac. Namely, in the fall of 1955, Holjevac found out that Belgrade was planning to build a new trade fair that was supposed to have an international character and should become the central fair event for the whole of Yugoslavia. This meant that the Zagreb Fair would have lost its significance and probably had been abolished as redundant, although it had a long tradition.<span id="ftn30_return"><a class="notelink" title="Mihaljević, “Stota obljetnica rođenja,” 8, 9." href="#ftn30"><sup>29</sup></a></span> Moreover, Zagreb would face an even higher degree of isolation. The Croatian Communist leadership did not see any problem in this, because they thought it reasonable for Belgrade, as the capital of Yugoslavia, to take precedence. Holjevac recognised the situation as a potential threat to the development and significance of Zagreb and reacted. He knew that the then location of the Zagreb Fair (Savska cesta) in the centre of the city was perspectiveless because the Fair could not spread due to the lack of space. He took full responsibility and decided to build a new fair at another, more favourable location. He neglected the five-year plan and ordered the entire Zagreb’s constructional industry to build the Zagreb Fair on the southern shore of Sava in only one year. Numerous associates told him that this was an impossible mission, especially because the project did not have the financial support of the state.<span id="ftn31_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ivan Strižić, Hrvatski portreti: lice i naličje hrvatskoga bića, 2nd ed. (Zagreb: DoNeHa, 1996), 282, 283." href="#ftn31"><sup>30</sup></a></span> However, the construction was completed within the deadline due to the maximum engagement, but also the financing model in which the states that were supposed to exhibit in Zagreb Fair build their pavilions themselves.<span id="ftn32_return"><a class="notelink" title="Rikard Štajner, “Skok preko Save,” in: Holjevac, graditelj, vizionar, ratnik, 49." href="#ftn32"><sup>31</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>Moving to a new location allowed the Zagreb Fair to remain the leading trade fair in Yugoslavia, which was not in favour of centralist-oriented politicians who, according to some opinions, have since become extremely dissatisfied with Holjevac. Moreover, Aleksandar Ranković, the most signifficant representative of the centralist circles within the top hierarchy of the Party, a longtime minister of interior, who had the greatest influence on the notorious State Security Administration (<span style="font-style:italic">Uprava državne bezbednosti</span> - UDBA), allegedly directly threatened Holjevac. A very well-informed journal of Croatian emigres <span style="font-style:italic">Nova Hrvatska</span>, wrote about Holjevac’s conflict with Ranković saying that Holjevac risked his life in the case of Zagreb Fair.<span id="ftn33_return"><a class="notelink" title="“Iznenadna smrt Većeslava Holjevca,” 5, 6." href="#ftn33"><sup>32</sup></a></span> In 1972, at the Zagreb District Court on the trial that was conducted against Franjo Tuđman, Tuđman said that Holjevac was threatened with potential persecution “because he was building a new trade fair without permission and because he retained in Zagreb the money that was supposed to go to the federal government.”<span id="ftn34_return"><a class="notelink" title="Franjo Tuđman, Usudbene povjestice (Zagreb: Hrvatska sveučilišna naklada, 1995), 258." href="#ftn34"><sup>33</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>According to Tatjana Holjevac’s testimony<span id="ftn35_return"><a class="notelink" title="“Povijesne kontroverze.”" href="#ftn35"><sup>34</sup></a></span> Aleksandar Ranković threatened Holjevac that he would face the consequences if he builds a new trade fair in Zagreb.

After four-hour talks, Tito gave support for the construction of the new Zagreb Fair.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">7</span>There are no documents available which can confirm that Ranković’s threat happened. Holjevac was a relatively high-rank politician and respected person, with a big reputation as people’s hero to be openly threatened. However, if we have in mind Ranković’s way of action, it is not impossible that he threatened Holjevac. As a longtime head of UDBA and internal affairs, Ranković used these institutions not only against the enemies of the state or the enemies of the ruling Communist Party but also as a means of control within the Party. At the time of Ranković’s political peak, there was a belief that he and his service keep the files on his comrades and that, if necessary, something compromising could be found on almost everyone.<span id="ftn38_return"><a class="notelink" title="See for example Josip Mihaljević, “Razilaženja u SKJ - marginalizacija Vicka Krstulovića,“ in: Disidentstvo u suvremenoj povijesti, eds. Nada Kisić Ko…" href="#ftn38"><sup>37</sup></a></span> In that sense, he could have some file on Holjevac and some dangerous material against him. Perhaps this might have been the fact that Holjevac’s older brother Leon was a member of the Croatian Home Guard. At the end of the war, he even gained a military rank, although he did not participate in any military action, but earned the rank as a musician playing in the military orchestra.<span id="ftn39_return"><a class="notelink" title="“Povijesne kontroverze”." href="#ftn39"><sup>38</sup></a></span> In his memoirs, Holjevac describes his brother as a man who was interested only in music, not in politics.<span id="ftn40_return"><a class="notelink" title="His memoirs (Zapisi iz rodnog grada), which he prepared for printing before his death, were published posthumously in 1972." href="#ftn40"><sup>39</sup></a></span> In the last days of the war, the Partisans captured him somewhere near Zagreb and killed him.

His mandate expired in October 1963.

Strižić points out that Holjevac was “the source for the generations of young intellectuals and students who were carriers of the Croatian Spring.”<span id="ftn84_return"><a class="notelink" title="Strižić, Hrvatski portreti, 289." href="#ftn84"><sup>83</sup></a></span></p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.5"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">Conclusion</span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The analysis of Holjevac’s political carrier confirms the claims that he was a “self-confident person who did not give up his political views.”<span id="ftn85_return"><a class="notelink" title="Spehnjak, “Većeslav Holjevac u političkim događajima 1967. godine,” 593." href="#ftn85"><sup>84</sup></a></span> Due to these characteristics, he occasionally came into conflicts with some of the leading figures of the then ruling League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Already in 1954, he attracted attention as a person who did not blindly follow the usual party praxis because he did not distance himself from some comrades that were thrown off in Party purges. As a member of the pro-reform and anti-dogmatic wing within the Party, he advocated Yugoslavia’s decentralisation and the equitable development of all its republics and regions. These endeavours of his were in contravention to the aspirations of the intercessors of centralism, primarily in Belgrade. With his actions at the local level, Holjevac irritated centralist circles, even their most important representative - Aleksandar Ranković. Regardless of whether Ranković’s threats were real or not, Holjevac’s insistence on creating the new Zagreb Fair was a move against the will of a party official who was above him in the Party hierarchy. Similar to this was the case of awarding Praxis intellectuals in 1966, in which he ignored the instruction that came from Vladimir Bakarić that they should not be rewarded.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The adoption of the Declaration on the Name and Status of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967 was an ideal moment for Bakarić to politically eliminate the disobedient and (perhaps) too popular Holjevac. Although he was not a signatory to the Declaration, the Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Croatia, proclaimed Holjevac as a nationalist. Holjevac’s insistence in Croatian patriotism was induced by the feeling that Croatia was withheld in Yugoslavia. That is why his political orientation was a struggle for “fair play politics” (<span style="font-style:italic">politika čistih računa</span>), which was the fundamental orientation of the Croatian Spring movement, which would flare up only a few years later. However, while Savka Dabčević Kučar and Miko Tripalo built up their popularity on that policy, Holjevac suffered a political fall. The difference was that Holjevac, as well as some others of his contemporaries, insisted on it too early, before the time in which it was possible to advocate such agenda publicly. Although he was one of the most popular Croatian politicians among the people, many years of isolation and early death prevented him to participate in the Croatian Spring.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Perhaps this fact holds the answer to the question why Croatian historiography has not published too much on Holjevac. While he was in high politics, he was still relatively young man, and was still relatively young when he experienced his political downturn. So, he did not get the satisfaction, which many of his even less deserving party comrades experienced, to see some historians writing about his life. On the other hand, after the collapse of communism and the creation of the Republic of Croatia, Većeslav Holjevac was not perceived as a man meritorious for Croatia’s national independence, because he did not participate in the Croatian Spring in 1971.

However, his character and political work are scarcely known to the public today. His merits in the cultural sphere are mostly forgotten, as well as the fact that he was one of the most important Croatian dissidents. The article presents the critical moments of his dissent and political disagreement with his comrades that led him to the role of the party renegade. The first dissident moment of his happened in 1954 when he did not distance himself from Marijan Stilinović, a Party comrade that was thrown off in a Party purge. However, maybe the crucial reason for Holjevac’s political decline was his hard advocacy of Yugoslavia's decentralisation and the equitable development of all republics and regions. As a member of the pro-reform and anti-dogmatic wing within the Party, he struggled against the aspirations of the intercessors of centralism. In 1955 Holjevac insisted on creating the new Zagreb Fair, which was a move against the will of Aleksandar Ranković, an influential party official who was above him in the Party hierarchy. Similar to this was the case of awarding Praxis intellectuals with the “Božidar Adžija” Awards in 1966. The highest Party officials considered their philosophical books unsuitable for the highest state prize. Holjevac, who was the president of the “Božidar Adžija” Awards Committee, ignored the instruction that came from Vladimir Bakarić that they should not be rewarded. The adoption of the Declaration on the Name and Status of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967 was an ideal moment for Bakarić to politically eliminate the disobedient and (perhaps) too popular Holjevac. Although he was not a signatory to the Declaration, the Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Croatia, proclaimed Holjevac as a nationalist. Holjevac’s case delineates the issue of the Croatian national reform movement known as the Croatian Spring. Due to his solid character, he was not afraid to defend his standpoints, even in the fights with communist comrades who were higher in the Party’s hierarchy, which caused his political decline. The article also discusses the claims that Holjevac was to become the leader of the Croatian Spring.</p></div><div lang="sl" class="summary" id="index.xml-back.1_div.3"><p class="docAuthor">Josip Mihaljević</p><h2 lang="sl"><span class="head">VEĆESLAV HOLJEVAC – POZABLJENI DISIDENT</span><br /><span class="head">POVZETEK</span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Hrvaški politik Većeslav Holjevac (1917–1970) velja za enega najuspešnejših županov mesta Zagreb. Kljub temu sta njegova osebnost in politično delo javnosti danes malo znana. Njegove zasluge na kulturnem področju so šle večinoma v pozabo, prav tako pa tudi dejstvo, da je bil eden najpomembnejših hrvaških disidentov. Članek predstavlja ključne trenutke njegovih disidentskih in političnih nesoglasij s tovariši, zaradi katerih si je v partiji prislužil status odpadnika. Do prvega nesoglasja je prišlo leta 1954, ko se ni oddaljil od partijskega tovariša Marijana Stilinovića, ki je med čistko v partiji izgubil svoj položaj. Morda se ključni razlog za politični propad Holjevca skriva v njegovem zagretemu zagovarjanju decentralizacije Jugoslavije in pravičnega razvoja vseh republik in regij. Kot član krila znotraj partije, ki se je zavzemalo za reforme in zavračalo dogmatska stališča, se je boril proti težnjam zagovornikov centralizma. Leta 1955 se je Holjevac zavzemal za ustanovitev novega zagrebškega sejmišča, kar je bilo v nasprotju z voljo takrat vplivnega partijskega uradnika Aleksandra Rankovića, ki je imel v primerjavi s Holjevcem pomembnejšo funkcijo v partijski hierarhiji. Podobno se je zgodilo leta 1966, ko so intelektualcem iz časnika Praxis podelili nagrado Božidarja Adžije. Najvišji partijski uradniki so namreč menili, da njihove knjige s filozofsko vsebino niso primerne za najvišjo državno nagrado. Holjevac, ki je deloval kot predsednik komiteja za nagrado Božidarja Adžije, ni upošteval navodil Vladimirja Bakarića, naj skupine ne nagradi. Sprejetje deklaracije o imenu in položaju hrvaškega knjižnega jezika iz leta 1967 se je izkazalo kot izvrstna priložnost, s katero je Bakarić neposlušnega in (morda) preveč priljubljenega Holjevca izrinil iz politične sfere. Čeprav Holjevac ni bil med podpisniki deklaracije, ga je Izvršni odbor Centralnega komiteja komunistične partije Hrvaške označil za nacionalista. Njegov primer odstira vprašanje hrvaškega gibanja za nacionalno reformo, imenovano Hrvaška pomlad. Zaradi močnega značaja ga ni bilo strah braniti svojih stališč celo v bojih s komunističnimi tovariši, ki so zasedali pomembnejše funkcije v hierarhiji partije, kar je povzročilo njegov politični zaton. Članek prav tako obravnava trditve, da naj bi Holjevac postal vodja Hrvaške pomladi.</p></div><!--Notes in [TEI]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Opombe</div><div class="note" id="ftn1"><span class="noteLabel">* </span><div class="noteBody"><span style="font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold">Research Fellow, PhD, Croatian Institute of History, Opatička 10, 10000-Zagreb, Croatia, </span><a class="link_ref" href="mailto:josip@isp.hr"><span style="font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold">josip@isp.hr</span></a></div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn1_return">↵</a></div><div class="note" id="ftn2"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><div class="noteBody"><span style="font-size:10pt">Juraj Hrženjak, ed., </span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Većeslav Holjevac: graditelj, vizionar, ratnik</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> (Zagreb: Savez antifašističkih boraca i antifašista Republike Hrvatske; Multigraf Marketing, 2006).</span></div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn2_return">↵</a></div><div class="note" id="ftn3"><span class="noteLabel">2. </span><div class="noteBody"><span style="font-size:10pt"> Iva Kraljević, “Većeslav Holjevac – predsjednik Matice iseljenika Hrvatske 1964. </span>– <span style="font-size:10pt">1968” (Magistarski rad, Sveučilište u Zagrebu, 2007).</span></div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn3_return">↵</a></div><div class="note" id="ftn4"><span class="noteLabel">3. </span><div class="noteBody"><span style="font-size:10pt"> Iva Kraljević, “Matica iseljenika Hrvatske 1964. – 1968.,” </span><span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic">Časopis za suvremenu povijest</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> 41, No. 1 (2009): 71–92.
