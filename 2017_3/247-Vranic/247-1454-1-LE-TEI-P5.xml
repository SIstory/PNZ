                the Kronprinzenwerk differed from the final product done by the local experts.
                Special emphasis is put on the volume’s editor, Izidor Kršnjavi and his
                editorial policy as well as on the image of Croatia-Slavonia and internal
                Croatian public debates which occurred during the editorial process of the

            <p><hi rend="italic">The Austro-Hungarian Empire in Word and Picture</hi> (Die
                österreichisch-ungarische Monarchie in Wort und Bild – also known as <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk)</hi> was initiated by Crown Prince Rudolf in
                1884. Contributions were mostly of folkloristic character describing and depicting
                each region’s customs, architecture, nature, geology, botany, etc. The idea behind
                the whole work was to represent the ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity of the
                Habsburg Monarchy. The Monarchy was presented as a state that transformed individual
                cultures into a new common culture from which all cultures profited. The implicit
                argument of the series was that the Monarchy had always been culturally and
                linguistically heterogeneous, so none of the ethnic groups can claim exclusive right
                to the territories.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="1">

                <hi rend="italic">The Kronprinzenwerk</hi> was part of the imperial cosmopolitan
                state’s response to increasing nationalisms throughout the Monarchy. The

                1885 and 1902 in 24 volumes with contributions from more than 400 authors and with
                4,500 illustrations. There were two editions of the <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk</hi> – Austrian and Hungarian. While the Austrian edition
                enjoyed commercial success, the Hungarian edition did not find a market, probably
                because the cultural policy it represented was not supported and advertised by the
                political circles in Hungary.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="3">

            <p>The last volume of <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk</hi> was on Croatia and
                Slavonia, with Izidor Kršnjavi as its editor. Kršnjavi had been educated in Vienna
                in the 1860s as an art historian and painter. During his studies, Kršnjavi was
                largely influenced by Viennese liberal circles and especially by his professor
                Rudolf von Eitelberger.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="4">

                            1861–1895</hi> (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013).</note> After
                returning to Croatia, Kršnjavi started teaching at the newly opened Zagreb
                University and became an important member of the People’s Party under the leadership
                of the new Ban Khuen Hedervary during the 1880s. From 1891 to 1896, Kršnjavi held
                the position of Minister of Religious Affairs and Education. He was forced to resign
                after a group of students burned the Hungarian flag during Emperor Franz Joseph’s
                visit to Zagreb in 1895. After his resignation, Kršnjavi continued teaching at the
                Zagreb University and remained one of the proponents of Dualism up until 1906 when
                he joined the Croatian Party of Right.</p>
            <p>The main intent of my article is to briefly outline the last volume of the <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk</hi> and the editorial ideas behind it, namely to
                present Croatia as a region of the Western cultural circle with a specific territory
                and culture. Special emphasis shall be placed on the ideological discrepancy
                seemingly apparent between the original project formulation and the content of the
                volume under research. Finally, I want to point out some of the key issues in the
                internal Croatian debates regarding the last volume of the <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk.</hi></p></div>
            <div><head>Croatia and Slavonia in the <hi rend="italic bold">Kronprinzenwerk</hi></head>
            <p>The last volume on Croatia and Slavonia was published in 1902. It was divided into
                four parts – history, people, culture and descriptions of particular towns and
                regions. The history section was divided into three parts – history of antiquity,
                history of national rulers and the Arpad dynasty, and history of the Anjou dynasty
                until the beginning of the modern period. As an addition to this history overview,
                there was a special article on church relations with the Serbian population. The
                section “people” consisted of three articles discussing the old folk religion,
                family relations and housing, folk crafts, and folk music. The section dealing with
                culture discusses Croatian and Serbian literature, and Croatian art and education.
                The last section gives brief descriptions of the land, namely ones of economic
                relations; forestry and hunting; regions of Primorje (Littoral region of the
                northern Adriatic), Lika, Turopolje, Zagorje, Podravina, Slavonia, Posavina and
                Sriem; cities of Zagreb, Senj, Žumberak/Sichelburg, Požega, Osijek/Esseg; and
                natural wonders such as the Plitvice lakes, the Kalnik hill, and the granite hills
                of Moslavina.</p>
            <p>In general, Kršnjavi’s introduction was a brief, poetic geographical description of
                the land. The country was described and illustrated as small picturesque towns which
                lacked modernization. Kršnjavi praised the role of the Habsburgs in modernizing
                these places by introducing railways and sewer systems. Such argumentation was
                typical for all of the <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk</hi> volumes – all regions
                and crownlands were inhabited with various groups of people that peacefully
                coexisted with the Habsburgs who served as legal protectors and who worked to
                modernize the less developed regions. Kršnjavi used geographical specificities such
                as the Sava and Drava rivers, hills and karst in order to create a separate
                character of Croatia and Slavonia distinct from Dalmatia. In his view, geographical
                conditions were also reflected in people’s characters depending on the geographical
                conditions of where they lived. He divided the people of Croatia into five groups
                based on region – Zagorje (Northern Croatia), Posavina (people around the Sava
                river), Podravina (North-eastern Croatia), Lika (the former Military Border), and
                the Serbs, although they inhabited all the regions.</p>
            <p>People from Zagorje were portrayed as blond, of medium height with bright eyes and
                strongly developed feelings for the respect of the law and justice. They were well
                organized and would easily rebel if someone did not respect their rights. In order
                to support this claim, Kršnjavi cited various peasant rebellions from the region and
                interpreted them as fights against breaches of the law. Contrary to the Croatians
                from Zagorje, Croatians from Podravina and the Posavina region were portrayed as
                dark-haired, easy-going and emotional. Croats from Lika were presented as tall,
                strong, resilient, traditional and unwilling to adapt to novelties. They were also
                presented as working in the forests outside their hometowns where they would earn
                money to support their families back at home.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="5">

            <p>These regional stereotypes were more picturesque and provisional, rather than racial.
                The most notorious racial stereotype of the region is probably the one developed
                during the First World War by the Serbian geographer Jovan Cvijić in which he
                claimed the Dinaric race was comprised of barbaric Highlanders and more civilized

                While Cvijić’s Balkanist discourse tried to prove differences between peoples of the
                Balkans and the Western world, Kršnjavi sought to present Croats from various
                regions as possessing the same culture as its Western counterparts, mostly with
                regard to “civilization” as it related to respect for laws and an organized
                state.</p>
            <p>Kršnjavi portrayed the Serbs in Croatia similarly to the Croats, as sharing common
                folk traditions and language, but separated by their usage of the Cyrillic script
                and the Orthodox religion. In Kršnjavi’s view, the difference between Catholicism
                and Orthodoxy was not only theological, but also cultural:</p>
            <p>“It is not the dogmatic nuances that should be considered as the point of division,
                but more probably it is the centuries long membership in two different cultural
                circles, to western Catholic and to Greek eastern orthodox, that separate the Croats
                and the Serbs, despite using the same language.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="7">

            <p>By making such a division, Kršnjavi implied that the Croats belong to the nations of
                the West, possessing their own culture and history, while the Serbs were grouped
                with the barbarian nations of the East, lacking culture and history. Nevertheless,
                one of the advantages of traditional Serbian lifestyle was its preservation of folk
                poetry, songs and crafts, contrary to “more cultural” Croatians that had been
                exposed to foreign cultural forms because of their participation in the intellectual
                life of the West.</p>
            <p>Although the Croats differed among themselves regionally, Kršnjavi also claimed that
                they shared common characteristics – honesty, reliability, religiosity, compassion
                and morality. In Kršnjavi’s view, such unique and traditional Croatian virtues,
                along with membership in the Hungarian kingdom, were the main reasons why the
                Croatian population had kept its political and national individuality, despite
                unfavorable geographical conditions.</p>
            <p>The next article of the volume dealing with the earliest history of the Croatian
                lands up until the middle ages was written by Kršnjavi’s former student and
                colleague, Ćiro Truhelka. His main aim was to pinpoint that the Croatian territories
                were part of cultural Europe since ancient times without temporal disruptions, even
                though they were not inhabited by the Croats. He constructed such continuity through
                similarities between Croatian Neolithic archeological findings, their Western
                counterparts that were replaced by Illyrian and Celtic cultures, and, finally, by
                connecting these territories to the Roman Empire.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9" n="8">

                incorporation of the Roman Empire to his argument was probably meant to prove the
                affiliation of the Croatian territories to, what was considered at the time, the
                last common culture of Europe. Even though the Croats did not inhabit the land at
                that time, being a part of cultural Europe could be proven on various levels by
                continuity of ornaments or architectural forms that the Croats could have adopted
                from the domestic population and used further after their migration to the region.
                The fact that they were intellectually capable of learning such complex knowledge,
                should also have secured their place among the cultural nations. Such a view opposed
                the one that argued that the Croats had arrived in the completely empty and
                desolated region of Dalmatia (there is a metaphor of Dalmatia as an empty house)
                expressed by the first professional Croatian historian, Franjo Rački, which was
                adopted by the majority of historians. While Truhelka wanted to show continuity and
                membership in the cultural sphere of the Roman Empire, Rački wanted to show how the
                Croats had migrated to an empty territory, so that no other nation could claim those
                territories.</p>

                Kršnjavi<hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">, </hi>was highly criticized.
                Kršnjavi gave a very brief description of Croatian history during the reign of the
                national rulers and the Arpad dynasty. Interestingly, he gave only slightly more
                space to the Croatian duke, Zdeslav, who ruled for only two years (878-879) with the
                help of Byzantium, and fell as a victim of a conspiracy. In Kršnjavi’s view, Zdeslav
                was an important ruler because he practically managed to unify all of Croatia, even
                if it was still theoretically divided. Under Zdeslav’s rule, Dalmatian coastal towns
                stopped paying a tribute to Byzantium, however they continued to pay a lower tax as
                a sign of Byzantium’s sovereignty.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="9">

                        Kršnjavi, “Der Zeit der Nationalen Herrscher und die Herrschaft der

                            Wort und Bild - Croatien und Slavonien</hi>, 34.</note> Most likely,
                Kršnjavi’s intention was to point out the importance of ruling a territory even if
                it was still nominally under another power, as well as Croatian historical rights to
                the Dalmatian coastal towns which were subjects of dispute between Croatian and
                Italian national activists.</p>
            <p>Ironically, Kršnjavi was attacked for writing separate histories of Croatia and
                Dalmatia for the <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk</hi>, although the majority of
                his historical article deals exclusively with the Croatian medieval history in
                Dalmatia. It would have been impossible for Kršnjavi, or anyone else, to write on
                early Croatian medieval history without discussing Dalmatia since there was almost
                no documentation for such an endeavor. If anything, Kršnjavi should have been
                “accused” of only writing the history of Dalmatia and for omitting the rest of
                Croatia. Generally, Kršnjavi presented Dalmatia as an integral part of the Croatian
                Kingdom. It remains unclear whether the Austrian and Hungarian editorial boards were
                aware of Kršnjavi’s editorial strategy or not, or whether they just lacked interest
                since his was the last volume of the series.</p>
            <p>The last part of the historical section was written by Ivan Bojničić and provided an
                overview of Croatian history from the late middle ages until contemporary times. The
                article lacked interpretation and consisted only of brief chronological data.
                Bojničić did not even interpret the conspiracy from the mid-seventeenth century of
                Nikola Šubić Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankopan against the emperor as a struggle for
                independence, which was one of the favorite arguments of anti-Austrian Croatian
                national activists. Nevertheless, Bojničić did reproduce a few politically correct
                messages on the last two pages of the article. First, he stated: “Modern Croatia
                stands on the side of historical rights and is, however, under the rule of all those
                factors through which it secured natural development of national
                    individuality.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn11" n="10">

                        82.</note> Since Bojničić held anti-Hungarian stances, he probably used
                the phrase “all those factors” as a compromise with the editorial board and
                Kršnjavi. According to this view, he presented Croatia as an autonomous unit which
                had managed to develop and preserve its national character/identity because it was
                part of larger state formations with Austria and Hungary. Bojničić also tackled the
                problematic nature of Croatia’s union with Hungary in the following away. In his
                view the Triune Kingdom formed a political community with Hungary, but that it
                constituted a separate territory and population:</p>
            <p rend="Quote">“The realms of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia
                    constitute together with Hungary and its adjoining lands one and the same
                    political community (Gemeinsamkeit), however Croatia-Slavonia possesses a
                    distinct territory, and its inhabitants are one political nation.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="11">
                        <?biblio ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"rl7mFqHw","properties":{"formattedCitation":"Ibid., 83.","plainCitation":"Ibid., 83."},"citationItems":[{"id":284,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1682833/items/AACTGIFD"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1682833/items/AACTGIFD"],"itemData":{"id":284,"type":"chapter","title":"Von den Anjou bis zur Neuzeit","container-title":"Die österreichisch-ungarische Monarchie in Wort und Bild - Croatien und Slavonien","publisher":"Druck und Verlag der kaiserlich-königlichen Hof- und Staatsdruckerei","publisher-place":"Wien","volume":"24","event-place":"Wien","author":[{"family":"Bojničić","given":"Ivan"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1902"]]}},"locator":"83"}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>Ibid.,
                        83.</note></p>
            <p>Such reasoning presupposed that the entire population of Croatia-Slavonia, regardless
                of nationality, formed a political nation that is itself supra-national and that
                consisted of various national and cultural elements. This view more broadly
                corresponds to the main argument of the <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk</hi>, that
                the population of the Monarchy also constituted one political nation composed of
                various elements. Interestingly, Bojničić omitted Dalmatia from his claim that
                Croatia-Slavonia has its own territory and population, yet he was not attacked in
                the daily press even though this argument had been made against Kršnjavi. It is also
                unclear from Bojničić’s line whether he considered the population of Dalmatia to be
                a member of “one political nation” or not.</p>
            <p>Finally, Bojničić concludes that Hungary wants the reunification of Croatia with
                Dalmatia (which was a crownland of the Austrian half of the Dual Monarchy), and that
                Croatian culture developed recently due to dualism as well as because of the
                Croatian-Hungarian compromise. Interestingly, the first claim managed to be approved
                by the Hungarian editorial board, although Hungary was probably the last one to
                fight for the incorporation of Dalmatia into Croatia, especially under Croatia’s
                conditions. Even if such unification was debated, it is more likely that Dalmatia
                would have to be incorporated into Hungary as a separate crownland with its own
                administration. The second argument, that of the recent development of Croatian
                culture, was probably suggested, or maybe even imposed by Kršnjavi, since
                contemporary Croatia needed to be presented as a successful result of Ban Khuen
                Hedervary’s modernization program, especially since Kršnjavi had been the key figure
                in Hedervary’s failed pacification and modernization project related to cultural
                matters. Despite the fact that Hedervary was still in power at the time of
                publishing the <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk</hi>, such argumentation was
                probably intended to show Kršnjavi’s loyalty to the Ban and the People’s Party; it
                was obvious to both the domestic and international public that Hedervary’s project
                was much different from what he wanted to present.</p>
            <p>Kršnjavi similarly argued further in the

                as a more or less autonomous land of the Crown of Saint Stephen, Croatian and
                Yugoslav identities had also developed and had been further strengthened through art
                during this period. The leader of Croatian artists, Vlaho Bukovac, had been adamant
                in his request for a separate pavilion for Croatian artists at the Millennial
                exhibition in Budapest in 1896. Similarly, a group of Croatian artists had refused
                to exhibit in the Hungarian pavilion during the Rome exhibition in 1911 after the
                Hungarian government refused to allow a separate entrance to the Croatian part of
                the pavilion. In the end they had actually exhibited their works in the Kingdom of
                Serbia’s pavilion. Contrary to Khuen Hedervary’s expectations, the development of
                Croatian art did not tie Croatia more closely to Hungary or to the Monarchy, but
                further developed cultural and political differences. Although Kršnjavi tried to
                present the development of Croatian art as a sign of Croatia’s political
                individuality, it seems he did it only for political reasons. In one of his public
                lectures in 1896, Kršnjavi analyzed the preconditions for the development of art and
                came to a diametrically opposite conclusion. He argued that art develops from
                patriotic or religious feelings, without the influence of political systems.</p>
            <p rend="Quote">”...one question imposes itself: what is the source of
                    great art? Is it in the political situation of a country? Is it in social
                    relations? Arts and crafts flourished in the most absolutist states of
                    antiquity, as well as in the freest lands of all ages – like in Egypt, Rome, and
                    the East. Social relations had no influence… Slavery in Egypt had the same
                    impact as freedom and wealth in America… One of the greatest and most important
                    sources is religion… The second source is patriotism. Whichever statesmen wants
                    to elevate the people on a higher level of culture, must advocate for art and
                    crafts. The one that ennobles needs will also enlarge them, but greater needs
                    are also a sign of higher civilization.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="13">

            <p>None of the afore-mentioned arguments by Kršnjavi can be considered to have been his
                strict conviction since he used both for specific audiences. The first argument was
                used to present Croatian culture as a result of political individuality to the
                international audience, while the second argument was used for the domestic public.
                Kršnjavi’s lecture needed to show to a domestic audience that art continues to
                develop, regardless of political circumstances, and that Croatia developed its art
                because of national and religious sentiments, despite unfavorable historical
                circumstances. Nevertheless, as we can see from the conclusion in the previous
                quotation, art needs to be constantly maintained and improved in order to continue
                confirming the nation’s participation in Western civilization. Both examples show us
                how Kršnjavi had no problems in adjusting his discourse to specific situations and
                how he consciously added hidden political messages to such discourse, even if
                expressing opposing opinions on the same matter.</p>
            <p>Returning to the article, Kršnjavi continued by giving a brief overview of Croatian
                art from the middle ages until his time. Again, his main concern was to show
                Croatian art to be a part of Western culture. Again, his discussion of Croatian
                medieval history of art cited only religious art from Dalmatia, which served
                Kršnjavi well to prove Croatian participation in Western Christianity and Western
                culture. Similarly, the article dealing with various cultural and scholarly
                institutions needed to prove that Croatia had reached that phase of civilization
                where it could autonomously manage its past and present like other Western nations.
                Kršnjavi also implicitly praised himself in the article while presenting
                contemporary Croatian artists who studied in the Crafts school in Zagreb and later
                continued their studies abroad with the help of the local government. Similarly, he
                provided an illustration in the volume of his former ministerial headquarters, which
                he had restored.</p></div>

            <p>Kršnjavi’s introduction caused bitter criticism from many Croatian nationalists,
                since he stated at the outset that Croatia and Dalmatia were two separate
                geographical units. In his view, Croatia and Slavonia were part of the Danube
                region, while Dalmatia was a part of the Mediterranean.</p>
            <p rend="Quote">“Croatia, Slavonia and by state right appurtenant
                    Dalmatia form in a geographical sense two completely different units.
                    Contemporary Croatia and Slavonia belong to the Danube region… while the coast
                    with Dalmatia and the islands belongs to the Adriatic… The main rivers of the
                    land, as natural traffic links, do not separate Croatia and Slavonia from
                    Hungary, but connect them together with thousand-year-old joys and sorrows.

            <p>Dinko Politeo criticized Kršnjavi’s division of Croatia and Dalmatia based on these
                different geographical characteristics. In Politeo’s view geographical
                characteristics did not influence the unity of the land, but only its human
                influence upon it. Therefore, he argued that Kršnjavi and other political opponents
                were implicitly responsible for Croatia’s territorial division.</p>
            <p rend="Quote">“But geography did not prevent us from being a unified

            <p>It is obvious that Politeo could not divide concepts of geographical and political
                unity, and therefore tried to point out the logical inconsistencies of Kršnjavi’s
                argument that Croatia shared a geographical unity with Hungary and Slovenia. In
                Politeo’s view, the geographical unity of Croatia and Slovenia should lead to the
                creation of a joint political body. Since Kršnjavi did not draw such a conclusion,
                Politeo accused him of working in the interests of Hungarians. </p>
            <p rend="Quote">“But Doctor Kršnjavi does not derive what he should –
                    all the consequences out of his theory. He stops there, where the system

                    Carinthia, but does not proceed further. That fact should lead him to form a
                    folk and political community of Croats and Slovenes. But Doctor Kršnjavi knows
                    that those in Budapest do not want it, so he does not even mention Slovenians.

            <p>Politeo also criticized Vlaho Bukovac’s allegorical picture at the beginning of the
                volume depicting Hungary and Croatia as two women. He was dissatisfied because
                Croatia was depicted as the weaker woman being hugged by a stronger one, namely
                Hungary. Interestingly, he did not attack Bukovac for painting such a picture, but
                only Kršnjavi for publishing it. Bukovac had probably accepted the commission only
                out of financial interest since he was the one who had made the ultimatum that
                Croatian artists must exhibit in a separate pavilion from Hungarian ones (the
                pavilion whose surrounding area was covered by that soil imported from Croatia) for
                the Millennial exhibition in Budapest in 1896.</p>
            <p rend="Quote">“Fascicule [the volume of Kronprinzenwerk] starts with
                    an allegorical painting by Vlaho Bukovac that depicts Hungary and Croatia. There
                    are two women above whom the crown of Saint Stephen is levitating. Hungary is a
                    proud woman being held full of dignity, whereas Croatia is a soft and cuddly
                    woman, swimming in joy because Hungary hugged her, took her under her aegis and
                    protection, and shook her hand. It is probable that this picture agrees with a
                    particular system, but it does not agree with history, national thought, and
                    Croatian honor.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="17">

            <p>Since the woman representing Croatia was depicted with the herald of the Triune

                interesting to note that Istria was not a subject of discussion regarding the
                possible unification of Croatian territories among Croatian national activists.
                Also, Kršnjavi did not refer to Istria in the volume and no one attacked him because

            <p rend="Quote">“The woman representing Croatia is recognized by the

            <p>Another point of controversy was Kršnjavi’s short note in the <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk</hi> about Croatian relations to Dalmatia in which he stated
                that Croatia and Dalmatia are parts of the same Kingdom, although under the current
                political division they were being separately represented. He explicitly stated that
                this note should be included in both the Austrian and Hungarian editions and this
                tells us that he probably worried that the Hungarian editorial board would try to
                misinterpret the Hungarian translation of the volume in favor of a more Hungarian
                version. The main dispute between Politeo and Kršnjavi was Dalmatia’s place in the
                Croatian state right tradition. While Kršnjavi argued that Dalmatia was currently
                under Austrian administration, although Croatian by state right, Politeo claimed
                that Dalmatian representation in the Austrian Reichsrat was contrary to state right
                which he considered interrupted.</p>
            <p rend="Quote">“Doctor Kršnjavi justifies in one footnote a
                    monstrosity and states that Dalmatia is considered by contemporary state right
                    as a Kingdom represented in the Reichsrat. Is it possible to change state right
                    from day to day? Croatian state right in Dalmatia exists and has lived since the
                    Croatian state was established. The fact that Dalmatia is being represented in
                    the Reichsrat is contrary to the state right… Dalmatia is, anyway, an integral
                    part of Croatia since the Croatian state’s existence, and that is way before the
                    Hungarian one. The Croatian state is established in Dalmatia and Croatian kings
                    were crowned by the crown as the kings of a powerful, Christian and cultural
                    state, even back in the times when Magyars were just arriving to

            <p>The majority of nationalist activists in the nineteenth century were concerned with
                proving and pointing out Croatia’s historical legal rights. It was a reflection of
                the social mindscape that a nation capable of proving that its historical rights
                were older was more legitimate and this justified its current political claims.
                Also, if historical rights were successfully proven by nineteenth century standards,
                the nation would be considered as an “historical people” and proved its right to an

            <p>The first quarrel regarding the
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Kronprinzenwerk </hi>came in 1899 when
                Kršnjavi asked Ivan Bojničić, the director of the State Archives, to write an
                overview of early medieval Croatian history up to year 1102. Bojničić naturally
                repeated the Croatian nationalist version of the story based on the <hi rend="italic">Pacta Conventa</hi> regarding the Croatian unification with
                Hungary in 1102. Bojničić stated that Croatia willfully joined the Hungarian Kingdom
                in contrast to the Hungarian version of the story which claimed the Croatian Kingdom
                was occupied by force. The problem arose when Bojničić refused to make corrections
                regarding his claims about the unification of the Hungarian and Croatian Kingdoms
                for the Hungarian edition of the <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk</hi>. Kršnjavi
                then asked Vjekoslav Klaić, professor of history at the University of Zagreb, to
                write a new overview, but Klaić immediately refused. Nevertheless, Bojničić wrote an
                overview of the period of Anjou rule in the Kingdom of Croatia, as we have seen
                previously. After Bojničić’s and Klaić’s rejections, Kršnjavi decided to write the
                overview himself. In his overview, as we have seen, Kršnjavi presented both a
                Croatian and a Hungarian version of the unification, and left it up to the readers
                to decide which version was more plausible.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn23" n="22">

            <p> Kršnjavi answered that he was a professional historian, and specifically a historian
                of culture. He also stated that he used a scholarly methodology by working with
                sources and field studies. Kršnjavi continued his defense by stating that his
                article underwent two anonymous peer reviews by Croatian historians and that the
                peer reviewers were not affiliated with the Hungarian committee. In general,
                Kršnjavi did not consider history to consist of politics and diplomacy, but of
                various other aspects which he tried to include as much as possible, especially
                cultural topics.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Obzor</hi> was probably informed of the nature of Kršnjavi’s work
                by either Bojničić or Klaić, both of whom rejected Kršnjavi’s suggestions. We can
                make such a supposition since the anonymous writer explicitly stated the reason why
                Kršnjavi posed a threat to Croatian national interests – the nature of the
                unification of the two kingdoms in 1102. Also, in his afore-mentioned response,
                Kršnjavi had mocked about Klaić’s and Smičiklas’ overviews of Croatian history as he
                considered one of them was most likely standing behind the press campaign.</p>
            <p>The anonymous author in <hi rend="italic">Obzor</hi> continued to explain how the
                topic is important for contemporary politics and state relations with Hungary, as
                well as for the role history plays in such debates. Although the author accused
                Kršnjavi of agreeing to present Croatia as occupied by king Coloman, the accusation
                later proved false because Kršnjavi presented both interpretations. Nevertheless, it
                is obvious that the idea of someone writing history against national interests and
                daily politics was completely alien to the author of the article, and probably even
                more so to the average readers of the daily press.</p>
            <p rend="Quote">“There are various points of disagreement among our
                    and Hungarian historians, but this one is fundamental for our state-legal

                    and Hungarian ones, regardless of the matter, our historians always triumphed,
                    either because of their knowledge, or because they had truth on their side. If
                    the rumors are true, Doctor Kršnjavi has failed and agreed with the Hungarian

            <p>Ivan Ružić similarly criticized Kršnjavi for not writing history from the Croatian
                perspective. To increase the persuasiveness of his argument, Ružić used an example
                of a Hungarian historian who “supported” the Croatian side. In his reply, Kršnjavi
                answered that such scholarship is a political issue and has nothing to do with
                history, nor it is the job of historians to deal with. The job of a historian, in

                an honest question by Josip Pasarić who asked Kršnjavi in the <hi rend="italic">Agramer Zeitung</hi> whether he stood on the Croatian or Hungarian side.
                Kršnjavi answered that he did not know a Croatian or a Hungarian side when it came

                historians trying to write an objective history. Politeo similarly, criticized
                Kršnjavi for writing history that suited Hungarian requests. His main concern was to

            <p>Since history was important to forming national consciousness, Politeo suggested that
                a special board should have been organized for the <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk</hi> volume on Croatia, consisting only of Croats, since the
                Hungarian editorial board would inevitably present Croatia as subordinate to
                Hungary. Such nationalist views presupposed that the history of a country could only
                be written by its native members, while others who tried to deal with the same
                issues were all perceived as potential enemies of the nation with hidden intentions.
                In such a social constellation, Kršnjavi was seen as an enemy since he was
                cooperating with the adversary Hungarian editorial board. It is interesting to note
                that the Viennese editorial board was usually omitted from these debates, as if it
                had no power in editorial policy and was seen as an ally in the political struggle
                against the Hungarians.</p></div>
            <div><head>Conclusion</head>
            <p>It is interesting to note that the articles in the <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk</hi> were written in the impersonal form and without the names
                of authors, who were instead only mentioned in the table of contents. The main
                purpose of such a style and form was to provide the illusion of coherent and
                objective knowledge which could not be disputed. The
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Kronprinzenwerk </hi>volume on Croatia was
                meant to serve as a kind of encyclopedia which could provide universal and objective
                knowledge to a foreign audience, although it remains unclear who the expected
                audience was. Since the
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Kronprinzenwerk </hi>was only published in
                German and Hungarian, the work could only be read by native speakers or people who
                had achieved higher than average education. The other issues, besides linguistics,
                were semantic ones because the work transmitted complex messages through various
                literary and artistic forms. Therefore, potential readers needed to have a certain
                prior knowledge and a scholarly apparatus in order to fully understand the
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Kronprinzenwerk </hi>and its implied
                messages. For this reason, it seems that even if an average individual with
                knowledge of German or Hungarian could read the work, they would most likely not be
                able to understand its implications, and would read it mostly out of curiosity, or
                simply because the volume dealt with their crownland. Most probably the
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Kronprinzenwerk </hi>was intended for a
                narrow group of elites such as state bureaucrats, politicians and academics in order
                to be a repository of useful knowledge, and something more fulfilling than simply
                cherishing the multicultural empire. Such knowledge could be later used to govern
                people or engage in political and academic debates. The work clearly projected
                imperial power and was part of the empire-building project. This imperial power
                aspect was partly reflected in the fact that the crownlands could not, and did not,
                oppose being represented in the work. They could only try to negotiate the character
                of their region’s portrayal, or particular authors could secretly express their own
                views in the work and hope the editorial boards would not reject it.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk</hi> unintentionally also became part of a
                nation-building process, despite originally being intended for empire-building,
                while denying rights of territorial exclusivity for any particular group. Instead of
                just mapping the heterogeneous empire, it also created stereotypical representations
                of particular groups. One of the main reasons for this was a lack of imperial
                personnel needed to complete the whole project. Instead, various experts and artists
                were hired from particular crownlands who expressed views not necessarily compatible
                with the imperial ones. It remains an open question of how much control editorial
                boards managed to exert over contributions to the volumes because of the sheer
                number of contributions they received and a lack of knowledge on specific
                crownlands. Considering the limited audience which could use the products from the
                project, it seems high expenditures did not justify the initial intentions of having
                the major artists and intellectuals from these crownlands contribute to the volumes.
                The <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Kronprinzenwerk </hi>illustrates how
                empire and nation worked hand in hand. Although the
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Kronprinzenwerk </hi>legitimated the empire
                by its fostering of the various regions and cultures, it also fostered the growing
                identities of those regions and cultures.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Kronprinzenwerk </hi>and its ideas were
                quite outdated by the time the project reached completion with the volume on Croatia
                and Slavonia in 1902, and would have been better suited for the mid-nineteenth
                century. Nevertheless, it fit Kršnjavi’s imperial worldview and his idea of dealing
                with politics by other means perfectly. As we have seen from the Croatian case, the
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Kronprinzenwerk </hi>did not manage to
                present differences as virtue, but deepened them further. Although Kršnjavi might
                not have supported the
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Kronprinzenwerk </hi>in every way, he
                probably used his political opportunism once more in accepting the editorial role in
                order to have control of Croatia’s presentation to the foreign public. Although the
                volume on Croatia was probably of no political importance to the highest
                decision-making elites of the Monarchy, Kršnjavi nevertheless managed in his
                political intentions, though different from the initial idea of the <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk,</hi> to present Croatia and Slavonia (and
                implicitly Dalmatia) as an autonomous and separate crownland (state) with its own
                independent institutions, culture and territory. </p></div>

            <p>Članek obravnava zadnji zvezek enciklopedije <hi rend="italic">Avstro-ogrska
                monarhija v besedi in podobi (The Austro-Hungarian Empire in Word and Picture
                oz. Die österreichisch-ungarische Monarchie in Wort und Bild)</hi>, znane tudi
                pod imenom <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk</hi>, ki jo je dal leta 1884 izdelati
                prestolonaslednik Rudolf. Čeprav je bila prvotna ideja celotnega dela predstaviti
                etnično, kulturno in jezikovno raznolikost Habsburške monarhije, avtor opozarja na
                spremembe v zadnjem zvezku. Za razliko od prvotne ideje o zavračanju pravic
                teritorialne ekskluzivnosti za posamezne skupine, zadnji zvezek predstavlja Hrvaško
                kot avtonomno kronsko domeno z jasno opredeljenimi ozemljem, kulturo in
                institucijami. Čeprav je bil glavni cilj takih imperialnih projektov boj proti naglo
                porajajočim se nacionalizmom, so tovrstni podvigi hkrati ustvarili prostor za
                razprave o nacionalizmu in nacionalistih. </p>
            <p>Glavni namen mojega članka je na kratko predstaviti zadnji zvezek enciklopedije <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk</hi> in njegove uredniške ideje, ki so formulirane
                tako, da je Hrvaška predstavljena kot regija zahodnega kulturnega območja s
                specifičnim ozemljem in kulturo. Avtor posveča posebno pozornost uredniku zadnjega
                zvezka Izidorju Kršnjaviju in njegovim uredniškim načelom kot načinu vodenja
                politike z drugačnimi sredstvi. Kljub Kršnjavijemu prizadevanju, da bi Hrvaško
                predstavil kot avtonomno regijo s posebnim ozemljem in kulturo, je s svojimi članki
                v enciklopediji <hi rend="italic">Kronprinzenwerk</hi> o srednjeveški Hrvaški in
                njeni zvezi s Kraljevino Ogrsko leta 1102 nehote sprožil burno javno in akademsko
