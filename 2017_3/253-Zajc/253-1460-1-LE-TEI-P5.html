            <p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>Borders and identities: two concepts, two
                conferences, and yet a single great topic for historiography. There are no borders
                without identities and identifications. Identities cannot exist without borders. Are
                we dealing with the two sides of the same coin? Both concepts (borders and
                identities) can only be discussed in the historical (and geographical) context. Both
                phenomena are clearly apparent and recurrently problematic in human societies, and
                both are undoubtedly never-ending processes. They are never the same, but always
                there. </p>
            <p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>In the framework of the project<span
                    style="font-style:italic"> The Phenomenon of Border Rivers</span> (financed by
                the Slovenian Research Agency, 2014–17), the Institute of Contemporary History
                supported two international conferences. The <span style="font-style:italic">Borders
                    and Administrative Legacy</span> conference was envisioned as the culmination of
                our work on the project. The main organiser was the Institute of Contemporary
                History in cooperation with the Department of History at the Faculty of Arts and the
                National Museum of Contemporary History. The purpose of the conference was to
                critically assess the methodological and conceptual power of the administrative
                legacy (borders) and landscape relations, as well as to subject it to theoretical
                and empirical historical research. Why "administrative legacy"? The administrative
                legacy represents the phantom past, structured in the official records of the
                states. It is vital for the legitimacy and status of the present. The legitimacy and
                meaning of the contemporary borders stem merely from the official records.
                Furthermore, borders can outlive the states that have created them. As the political
                space changes, the obscure parts of the administrative legacy suddenly become
                important: cadastral municipality borders, police districts, etc. The
                Slovenian–Croatian maritime border, for instance, never existed in Yugoslavia, but
                what did exist was the administrative practice of (federal) police supervision over
                the waters of the Adriatic Sea. When the issue of the maritime border between the
                newly independent states arose, the technical "division of labour" – police
                supervision – became a question of national interest.</p>
            <p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>The Department of History at the Faculty of
                Arts in Ljubljana was the main organiser of the second event, the conference
                entitled <span style="font-style:italic">Identities, Categories of Identification,
                    and Identifications between the Danube, the Alps, and the Adriatic</span>.
                Recent research has shown that even after the rise of nationalisms, nation-ness was
                not (and still is not) relevant for the entirety of the populace, and it has not
                been relevant in all situations. Many scholars see group identities as a result of
                non-determinate processes, which have always had alternatives. Those unrealised
                options are not historical mistakes (as the traditional national historiography has
                assumed), but simply alternatives that have not been successful. The very fact that
                they have appeared proves that they have had a certain potential. The aim of the
                conference was to respond to these challenges with historical case studies: how have
                the identities and identifications in the region between the Danube, the Alps, and
                the Adriatic appeared, disappeared, or transformed.</p>
            <p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>The Canadian political scientist Emmanuel
                Brunet-Jailly, the keynote speaker at the conference on borders and administrative
                legacy, reminded the historians (who are used to studying concrete historical
                situations) of the importance of the "bird’s eye view" and the "longue durée"
                perspective. Since the beginning of agriculture, borders have been a permanent
                attribute of human political life. Brunet-Jailly identified two long-term trends:
                the trend of political fragmentation (there are now more independent states than
                ever before), and the trends of discipline (societies based on borders in space) and
                supervision (societies based on the control of the "flows" of people and goods). Due
                to the development of biometrics, people now carry borders "within themselves". </p>
            <p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>Are people as "walking borders" really a new
                phenomenon? The "bird’s eye view" can reveal historical structures "from above", but
                only the "worm’s eye view" of historical case studies can reveal how historical
                structures actually work. Pieter Judson, a professor at the European University
                Institute in Florence and the keynote speaker at the conference on identities and
                identifications, emphasised the importance of case studies for understanding the
                difference between identification and identities. If historians truly want to
                understand nationalism and other competing loyalties, they need to concentrate on
                identifications, not identities. Identities are in fact only narrow categories of
                people. Identifications are more precise; they are "made" by people themselves in
                order to negotiate their existence in a complex society. If we boldly develop his
                advice further, we can entertain a thought that people had been "walking borders"
                long before the invention of digital biometrics. </p>
            <p><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>The organisers of both conferences decided to
                disperse the papers to different publications in order to promote the achievements
                of both conferences in different environments. Our issue contains seven
                contributions: four papers that were presented at the <span
                    style="font-style:italic">Borders and Administrative Legacy </span>conference,
                and three from the conference entitled <span style="font-style:italic">Identities,
                    Categories of Identification, and Identifications between the Danube, the Alps,
                    and the Adriatic.</span> Lili Zách, Stipica Grgić, and the author of this
                editorial dealt with borders "in the field" as well as the borders captured in the
                official records. Lili Zách investigated the transformation of political space in
                Ireland and Central Europe in the period after the First World War. The
                establishment of the borders in the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire
                has had an interesting impact on the Irish border question. Stipica Grgić offered a
                profound analysis on the issue of border changes in the Štrigova and Razkrižje
                micro-region (today divided between Slovenia and Croatia). Marko Zajc, on the other
                hand, chose the combination of environmental history and border studies approach to
                analyse two long-term aspects of the border river phenomenon with the example of the
                Mura River: the relationship between the river and the boundary line, and the
                relationship between historical structures and border disputes. Scott Moore did not
                focus on borders, but rather on the issue of the Habsburg imperial legacy: the
                post-war Austrian schools used programs identical to those from the Habsburg period
                in order to develop patriotism in students.</p>
            <p><span class="numberParagraph">7</span>The three contributions that were presented at
                the conference on identities and identifications focused on the period of the late
                    19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century. Igor Vranić chose the
                Croatian art historian and politician Izidor Kršnjavi as the subject of his
                interest. He analysed Kršnjavi’s interpretation of the role of Croatia in the
                Imperial (and European) symbolic geography. Étienne Boisserie and Martin Jemelka
                presented detailed case studies of the Slovak national movement. The former explored
                the relations between family networks and patriotic activities, while the latter
                focused on the workers' religious and national identifications and changes in the
                Ostrava region.</p>
            <p><span class="numberParagraph">8</span>Most of the presentations from both conferences
                were recorded and are available at our Sistory.si portal as video lectures. </p>
