            <p>Borders and identities: two concepts, two conferences, and yet a single great topic
                for historiography. There are no borders without identities and identifications.
                Identities cannot exist without borders. Are we dealing with the two sides of the
                same coin? Both concepts (borders and identities) can only be discussed in the
                historical (and geographical) context. Both phenomena are clearly apparent and
                recurrently problematic in human societies, and both are undoubtedly never-ending
                processes. They are never the same, but always there. </p>
            <p>In the framework of the
                project<hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve"> The Phenomenon of Border Rivers</hi>
                (financed by the Slovenian Research Agency, 2014–17),
                the Institute of Contemporary History supported two international conferences. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Borders and Administrative Legacy</hi> conference was
                envisioned as the culmination of our work on the project. The main organiser was the
                Institute of Contemporary History in cooperation with the Department of History at
                the Faculty of Arts and the National Museum of Contemporary History. The purpose of
                the conference was to critically assess the methodological and conceptual power of
                the administrative legacy (borders) and landscape relations, as well as to subject
                it to theoretical and empirical historical research. Why "administrative legacy"?
                The administrative legacy represents the phantom past, structured in the official
                records of the states. It is vital for the legitimacy and status of the present. The
                legitimacy and meaning of the contemporary borders stem merely from the official
                records. Furthermore, borders can outlive the states that have created them. As the
                political space changes, the obscure parts of the administrative legacy suddenly
                become important: cadastral municipality borders, police districts, etc. The
                Slovenian–Croatian maritime border, for instance, never existed in Yugoslavia, but
                what did exist was the administrative practice of (federal) police supervision over
                the waters of the Adriatic Sea. When the issue of the maritime border between the
                newly independent states arose, the technical "division of labour" – police
                supervision – became a question of national interest.</p>
            <p>The Department of History at the Faculty of Arts in Ljubljana was the main organiser
                of the second event, the conference entitled <hi rend="italic">Identities,
                    Categories of Identification, and Identifications between the Danube, the Alps,
                    and the Adriatic</hi>. Recent research has shown that even after the rise of
                nationalisms, nation-ness was not (and still is not) relevant for the entirety of
                the populace, and it has not been relevant in all situations. Many scholars see
                group identities as a result of non-determinate processes, which have always had
                alternatives. Those unrealised options are not historical mistakes (as the
                traditional national historiography has assumed), but simply alternatives that have
                not been successful. The very fact that they have appeared proves that they have had
                a certain potential. The aim of the conference was to respond to these challenges
                with historical case studies: how have the identities and identifications in the
                region between the Danube, the Alps, and the Adriatic appeared, disappeared, or
                transformed.</p>
            <p>The Canadian political scientist Emmanuel Brunet-Jailly, the keynote speaker at the
                conference on borders and administrative legacy, reminded the historians (who are
                used to studying concrete historical situations) of the importance of the "bird’s
                eye view" and the "longue durée" perspective. Since the beginning of agriculture,
                borders have been a permanent attribute of human political life. Brunet-Jailly
                identified two long-term trends: the trend of political fragmentation (there are now
                more independent states than ever before), and the trends of discipline (societies
                based on borders in space) and supervision (societies based on the control of the
                "flows" of people and goods). Due to the development of biometrics, people now carry
                borders "within themselves". </p>
            <p>Are people as "walking borders" really a new phenomenon? The "bird’s eye view" can
                reveal historical structures "from above", but only the "worm’s eye view" of
                historical case studies can reveal how historical structures actually work. Pieter
                Judson, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence and the keynote
                speaker at the conference on identities and identifications, emphasised the
                importance of case studies for understanding the difference between identification
                and identities. If historians truly want to understand nationalism and other
                competing loyalties, they need to concentrate on identifications, not identities.
                Identities are in fact only narrow categories of people. Identifications are more
                precise; they are "made" by people themselves in order to negotiate their existence
                in a complex society. If we boldly develop his advice further, we can entertain a
                thought that people had been "walking borders" long before the invention of digital
                biometrics. </p>
            <p>The organisers of both conferences decided to disperse the papers to different
                publications in order to promote the achievements of both conferences in different
                environments. Our issue contains seven contributions: four papers that were
                presented at the
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Borders and Administrative Legacy </hi>conference,
                and three from the conference entitled <hi rend="italic">Identities, Categories of
                    Identification, and Identifications between the Danube, the Alps, and the
                    Adriatic.</hi> Lili Zách, Stipica Grgić, and the author of this editorial dealt
                with borders "in the field" as well as the borders captured in the official records.
                Lili Zách investigated the transformation of political space in Ireland and Central
                Europe in the period after the First World War. The establishment of the borders in
                the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire has had an interesting impact on
                the Irish border question. Stipica Grgić offered a profound analysis on the issue of
                border changes in the Štrigova and Razkrižje micro-region (today divided between
                Slovenia and Croatia). Marko Zajc, on the other hand, chose the combination of
                environmental history and border studies approach to analyse two long-term aspects
                of the border river phenomenon with the example of the Mura River: the relationship
                between the river and the boundary line, and the relationship between historical
                structures and border disputes. Scott Moore did not focus on borders, but rather on
                the issue of the Habsburg imperial legacy: the post-war Austrian schools used
                programs identical to those from the Habsburg period in order to develop patriotism
                in students. </p>
            <p>The three contributions that were presented at the conference on identities and
                identifications focused on the period of the late 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                and early 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century. Igor Vranić chose the Croatian
                art historian and politician Izidor Kršnjavi as the subject of his interest. He
                analysed Kršnjavi’s interpretation of the role of Croatia in the Imperial (and
                European) symbolic geography. Étienne Boisserie and Martin Jemelka presented
                detailed case studies of the Slovak national movement. The former explored the
                relations between family networks and patriotic activities, while the latter focused
                on the workers' religious and national identifications and changes in the Ostrava
                region. </p>
            <p>Most of the presentations from both conferences were recorded and are available at
                our Sistory.si portal as video lectures. </p></div>
