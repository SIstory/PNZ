                have the support of the majority of the residents in the former compact Municipality
                of Štrigova in the north-western part of Međimurje, visited various Yugoslav state
                institutions in Belgrade. Emphasizing transportation, economic, cultural,
                educational and national reasons, they appealed to the central authorities in order
                to ensure that their small region, consisting of several settlements, becomes a
                permanent part of the Federal People’s Republic of Slovenia. They claimed that the
                state institutions were the only relevant factor with the authority to resolve this
                inter-republic Slovenian-Croatian border conflict and propose a final solution in
                the era in which the state promoted “brotherhood and unity” and avoided even the

                overthrown, with the further development of local institutions and articulation of
                political and institutional nationalism on a local level. It will also highlight the
                importance of various local educational, economic and other social conditions which
                contributed to the articulation of attitudes of these communities about their

                they were placed on – what they considered to be – the “wrong side” of the border.

            <p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The Municipality of Štrigova was formed in the
                mid-19th century. It comprised 45 individual villages and hamlets scattered across
                9.351 square acres of mountain terrain. The settlements were quite disjointed and
                had a relatively few number of inhabitants. In 1910 Štrigova itself had only 433
                inhabitants and Razkrižje, one of the other larger settlements in the municipality,
                numbered only 229 inhabitants.<span id="ftn5_return"><a class="notelink"

                a part of Čakovec District, which was under the rule of the Hungarian-based Zala
                County. The Hungarian government and its policy of repression towards the Slavs,
                which was, for instance, evident in education, was in fact counterproductive; it
                slowly shaped the identity of the Slavic population in an undesired direction. In
                the first decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the resistance directed towards
                the efforts of the Hungarian authorities was mostly peaceful. However, after the
                collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of 1918, an open revolt occurred. It was
                fueled by the difficult economic and political situation that came with the last
                year of the First World War. The Hungarian authorities’ decision to send their army
                to this area was entirely counterproductive. The local Croatian and Slovenian
                politicians, tempted by the idea of the South Slavic unity, begun seeking help from

                consequently placed it entirely under the jurisdiction of the Zagreb provincial

                self-determination was recognized and thus began the integration of Međimurje (and
                the neighboring Prekmurje) into the administrative and other systems of the newly

                region, which had its seat in Zagreb. However, in 1931 Štrigova Municipality was
                separated from Čakovec District and the rest of Međimurje and placed under the

                administrative units, from regional to municipal, in an effort to produce not only a
                functioning administration, but also a new set of allegiances towards themselves and
                the concept of integral Yugoslavism which they promoted. The state announced that
                their boundaries would be formed according to economic and transportation
                principles, and that former ethnic divisions between South Slavic people will simply

                including the municipalities of Štrigova and Razkržije, was from 1941 to mid-1945

                changes which happened in the centers of power which surrounded them and claimed
                this territory. This shows the undemocratic character of the border changing
                processes in this area, which affected the behavior of the inhabitants and developed
                the idea of a border as something arbitrary, a line which, for some reason, does not

                look at the multi-level dispute within the municipal community. It manifested on a
                local level in economic, cultural and political manner. It should be noted that
                Štrigova Municipality in that era consisted of a lot of mountain territory and that
                the central settlement itself had only several hundred residents. The inhabitants of
                the marginal parts of this municipality, broken into a number of villages and
                hamlets, due to the terrain configuration, experienced transportation isolation and
                some had problems when trying to reach Štrigova, the center of the municipality, or
                Čakovec, the seat of their district.</p>

                part of the once unified Štrigova Municipality and its central or south part became
                more obvious during the 1930s. The inhabitants of Razkrižje and other “northern”
                settlements clearly resented the efforts of the local teachers and priest who came
                from Štrigova, and were sent by Zagreb’s administrative and ecclesiastical
                authorities. They accused them of being unable to adjust to local circumstances
                (language, mentality), but also of “denationalization” of their children. In 1933
                they petitioned the Drava Banovina authorities for a teacher who would teach their
                children in the Slovenian language. Soon, the primary school in Šafarsko near

            <p><span class="numberParagraph">10</span>The news about the agreement in 1946 only
                caused further polarization in the Štrigova-Razkrižje micro-region. Two distinct

                become a part of Slovenia. This group enjoyed strong support among the inhabitants,
                especially in Razkrižje itself. The Slovenian side, led by Simon Kutnjak and Ivan
                Horvatič, both from Razkrižje, were promising a better life, less taxes and a market
                (in Ljutomer) more open to the sale of the farmers’ products and wine than the one
                in the Croatian district centre (Čakovec).<span id="ftn38_return"><a

                historical connection of this area to Croatia and even used data from the former
                census to support this. The Croatian side, led by Josip Alt from Štrigova, pointed
                out that 98% of the population in the area felt Croatian.<span id="ftn40_return"><a

                Yugoslavia, as its highest legislature, was responsible for the division of
                territories between the republics. However, the same article explained that any

                closer to Ljutomer “didn’t have a clearly defined national affiliation, and were in
                many ways (mentality, similar language) closer to Slovenes”, the answer to the
                question of what language residents of Razkrižje should use was: “The same as in

                the process of nation-building was not completed in this area by 1946. In reality,
                the people who opted for Slovenia felt that their language was Slovenian, and those
                who opted for Croatia felt that they spoke and wrote Croatian. In fact, individuals
                often refused to declare themselves nationally, preferring regional self-awareness.
                Even when they were directly confronted by the Control Commission about whether they
                felt as Slovenes or Croats, most of the interviewed residents often argued that they

                Croatia and Slovenia. On the other hand, after some new letters came during the
                summer of 1946, the federal Control Commission clearly emphasized that it would
                reject all new redrawing demands, except those requests which resulted from thorough
                discussions among the relevant district or county authorities (Ljutomer and Maribor
                on the Slovenian side, Čakovec and Varaždin on the Croatian side). They thought
                these types of requests “just [serve] to incite chauvinistic hatred and ruin the

                rated these demands as products of “reactionary individuals”, “former Korošec’s
                people”, who sought to sow the seed of national discord between Slovenes and Croats.

            <h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head">Conclusion</span></h2>
            <p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The problem of the Slovenian-Croatian border in
                Međimurje, in today’s municipalities of Štrigova and Razkrižje, is more complex than
                it first appears. We can argue that many factors conditioned the present
                configuration of the border. One of the most important ones is the constant change
                of the state borders in this area. From the end of the First World War in 1918 until
                1946, the first year after the end of World War II, this whole area was under the
                Hungarian authorities twice (1918, 1941-1945), three times under Slovenian authority
                (1924-1929, 1931-1941, 1945-1946), three times under Croatian authority (1918-1924,
                1929-1931, 1946), and even under the Third Reich for a few months (1941). This
                brought instability, especially in an area where people identified themselves
                differently and national division had not yet been clearly established. However, in
                the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, due to the work of some “old” institutions (the
                Catholic Church, schools), as well as some new institutions (for instance the new
                Municipality of Razkrižje, established in 1937), the inhabitants became increasingly
                politically fragmented and they started to notice their differences in terms of
                language, school and economic preferences. By the summer of 1946, the situation
                changed again. Harsh post-war years brought economic and political instability and
                generated the local Štrigova-Razkrižje conflict, which grew into a conflict between
                the pro-Slovene and pro-Croatian sides. Both sides claimed that they had the support
                of most of the inhabitants of the Štrigova-Razkrižje micro-region and promised the
                people a better life if they supported their claims. After a large number of
                complaints reached the highest state authorities, three members of the federal
                Control Commission came out to this territory in 1946. They conducted interviews
                with the residents and in the end they draw a temporary border between the two
                republics in this area, the border that for the most part followed the 1937 border
                between the municipalities of Štrigova and Razkrižje. Although the National Assembly
                later never discussed nor passed the law concerning the Slovene-Croatian border in
                this area, this line became the national border between the Republic of Slovenia and
                Republic of Croatia as we know it today.</p>

                trditi, da je na določanje meje pustilo veliko sled pogosto spreminjanje
                administrativnih meja na tem področju v preteklosti, saj je samo od leta 1918 pa do
                leta 1946 področje občine Štrigova, od katere je bil leta 1937 odcepljen del in
                ustanovljena samostojna občina Razkrižje, z vidika središč, ki so bila zanj
                pristojna, celo devetkrat zamenjalo pripadnost med današnjo Madžarsko, Slovenijo in
                Hrvaško. Poleg tega lahko rečemo, da niti sami prebivalci tega kraja niso imeli
                popolnoma jasne predstave o svoji nacionalni identiteti ter da so se opredeljevali
                za prebivalce posameznih naselij ali pa regionalno kot Medžimurci.</p>
            <p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Kljub dolgoročnemu delovanju raznih lokalnih
                institucij, ki so se trudile z nacionalnim profiliranjem prebivalcev (šole, cerkev,
                občine), je konec druge svetovne vojne temu pretežno agrarnemu kraju prinesel nove
                težave. Gospodarska in politična nestabilnost je leta 1946 privedla do vse
                močnejšega profiliranja lokalnega prebivalstva v proslovensko in prohrvaško strujo,
                ki so se trudile, da bi področje prejšnjih občin Razkrižje in Štrigova spadalo v
                Slovenijo oziroma Hrvaško. Ker je spor teh dveh taborov vse bolj preraščal v
                nacionalni spor, so se v določanje meje vključile osrednje institucije socialistične
                Jugoslavije. Nadzorna komisija Zvezne skupščine je leta 1946 ustanovila posebno
                tričlansko komisijo (Lepa Perović, Vida Tomšič, Pavle Gregorić), ki je prišla na
                teren in po preučitvi vseh argumentov leta 1946 določila mejo, in sicer tako, da je
                severna tretjina spornega območja pripadla Sloveniji (vasi in zaselki Globoka,
                Veščica, Gibina, Razkrižje, Šafarsko in del vasi Banfi), preostali del pa je
                pripadel Hrvaški (vasi in zaselki Grabrovnik, Leskovec, Jalšovec, Sveti Urban,
                Stanetinec, Mali Leskovec, Robadije, Štrigova, Železna Gora in manjši del vasi
                Banfi). Ta začasna odločitev nikoli ni bila potrjena, a jo v bistvu še danes
                sprejemata tako slovenska kot hrvaška stran kot končno mejo dveh suverenih držav na
                tem področju.</p>
