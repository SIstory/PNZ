This action was historically based in three small counties at the north of the Kingdom (Liptov, Orava, and Turiec) and connected with the mid-sized cities in the surrounding counties. The main patriotic activities were concentrated in this area, especially in Martin, with the Slovak National Party or SNS (founded in 1871), the press (mostly one daily and one monthly newspaper that can be considered as the sole political and cultural papers), and the main non-confessional associations. </p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>The leading position of Martin was challenged in the 1890s. This challenge came from networks built and developed in Prague and Vienna, where a handful of Slovak students had organized themselves in small groups and had been developing connections and solidarities for about a decade. Coming mostly from the Orava-Liptov-Turiec triangle, they were inspired by what is usually called “the spirit of Martin” [<span style="font-style:italic">Martinský duch</span>]. Some others were from what is called “Western Slovakia”<span id="ftn5_return"><a class="notelink" title="In the narrow sense of the word, “Western Slovakia” is the region located to the North-West of Bratislava, extending to the border with Moravia. In th…" href="#ftn5"><sup>4</sup></a></span>, where connections with Vienna and South Moravia were more frequent. The region, which was less influenced by the “historical core” of the movement and more connected to non-Hungarian parts of the monarchy, had already been organized based on the economic proximity and agricultural networks. Moreover, it was one of the regions active in creating cooperatives in the mid-century period and was close to Pressburg, where active upper-middle class Slovak patriots worked mostly as lawyers, organizing critics of the “conservative” or “old” centre, i.e. Martin. To name but two of those involved in what Pavol Blaho later called “the Awakening of the West”<span id="ftn6_return"><a class="notelink" title="SNA, BA, of. Blaho, carton (c.) 76, inv. č. (No.) 2059." href="#ftn6"><sup>5</sup></a></span>: Jozef Dérer and Miloš Štefanovič, who were both lawyers in Bratislava and close friends. Although they had connections with the Party in Martin, they both developed harsh criticism towards what is frequently referred to as the “old” centre”, especially the latter of the two, who is seen as <span style="font-style:italic">enfant terrible</span> of the Slovak politics.<span id="ftn7_return"><a class="notelink" title="About Miloš Štefanovič and his role in redefining the Slovak national programme, see Milan Podrimavský, Slovenská národná strana v druhej polovici 19.…" href="#ftn7"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Both of them are also interesting as representatives of what can be considered in hindsight as the transitional generation or “the intermediate outside-Martin generation“, embedded between a classical, language-focused approach to the national question and its further development. Both men belonged to families involved in the main cultural and political events, including the voluntary actions from the 1840s to the 1850s. Miloš Štefanovič was one of the most prominent figures of this generation. His patriotic pedigree was irreproachable: his father Samuel was one of the 22 members of the Permanent National Committee founded after the adoption of the 1861 Memorandum in Martin.<span id="ftn8_return"><a class="notelink" title="See Slovenské národné zhromaždenie v Turčianskom Sv.

This is also a clue to the increasing role of the Western counties, including Pressburg, in the Slovak politics at the beginning of the 1890s. Miloš Štefanovič was a lawyer working in the city from 1887, having started his career at Dula’s office in Martin.

Critical of Martin, this generation was headed by two former figures of the voluntary milieu of Vienna and Prague in the preceding decade, i.e. Pavol Blaho and Vavro Šrobár. Both were medics, the first from the West, the second from Liptov; both were born in 1867; the first studied in Vienna, the second in Prague; and both either founded or led the most representative Slovak students’ associations in the respective cities: the “Národ” in Vienna, and the “Detvan” in Prague.<span id="ftn10_return"><a class="notelink" title="About Národ, see SNA, of. BlahoBlaho, Pavel (1867-1927), c. 76, No. 2038.

He read the <span style="font-style:italic">Národnie Noviny </span>[National journal], admired Hurban-Vajansky’s poetry and the Russophile trend, and read Russian writers extensively, mainly Tolstoy”. Both Blaho and Šrobár though were deeply influenced by the political transformations they observed in Vienna and Prague respectively, particularly by the emergence of the “progressive” current in the Czech Lands: a more radical, nationally and socially focused trend in the Czech politics that challenged the classical “activist” orientation of the still dominant Young-Czech elite.<span id="ftn12_return"><a class="notelink" title="Jiří Kořalka, Češi v habsburské říši a v Evropě 1815–1914 [The Czechs in the Habsburg Empire and in Europe] (Prague: Argo, 1996).

In a long letter to Žigmund Pauliny-Tóth, who belonged to one of Martin’s most important Slovak families and headed the first Slovak bank – the Tatra banka – at the time, he was quite clear on that point: “I think we are opening a new era in Slovakia, a new period of awakening, a new era of the Slovak life reformation. But, for now, it is still far away.”<span id="ftn16_return"><a class="notelink" title="LA SNK, A 1505, Šrobár to Pauliny-Tóth, 13 June 1898." href="#ftn16"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>The main target of those called “hlasists” was “Štúrism”, named after Ľudovít Štúr, who codified the Slovak language. Combined with the mighty Russophilia that impregnated the Slovak movement, “Štúrism” was considered an ideology that led to a weakening of political and cultural action and to sterile conservatism. Because of it, the “really practical” and “concrete” work was forgotten for years, if not decades, and the Slovak mainstream gradually moved away from the people. This people’s dimension of politics had to be reintroduced in any kind of activities under the motto of “concrete small social work”, which was adapted from the Czech Lands; it implied the education and information campaigns, creation of cultural or educational associations on a very local basis, and spreading of technical and scientific knowledge among people. The <span style="font-style:italic">Hlas</span> was also a weapon against renouncement, with the political passivity of the SNS being analysed as such.<span id="ftn17_return"><a class="notelink" title="Vavro Šrobár, “Počiatky slovenského obrodenia,” [The beginnings of the Slovak awakening] in: Sborník slovenskej mladeže, [Slovak youth collection] 190…" href="#ftn17"><sup>16</sup></a></span> When assessing the preceding decade in 1908, Šrobár underlined that, “at that time, there was absolutely no autonomous political movement in Slovakia. The Slovak intelligentsia was declining year by year as the cruel Hungarian liberal regime had pushed it out of public politics and restricted it to the private sphere. Between the Slovak intelligentsia and the Slovak people, an unbridgeable rift was growing; people had lost their leaders, and their leaders had lost the battle. [...] Some were certain that our liberation would come from the East, others assured with the same certainty that it would come from the West, from the dynasty. This had only one consequence on the Slovak life: it fell asleep”.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>At the turn of the century and a few more years afterwards, the hlasists worked along another new trend in the Slovak intelligentsia, the Catholics<span id="ftn18_return"><a class="notelink" title="R. Holec, Tragédia v Černovej a slovenská spoločnosť [The Tragedy of ČernováČernová and Slovak society] (Martin: Matica slovenská, 1997), 21–24." href="#ftn18"><sup>17</sup></a></span>, in order to develop what was called “concrete small social work”. This was the Slovak version of the Czech “small work”, which mostly consisted of evening lectures and conferences, and establishment of cultural and educational associations and cooperatives, especially in the rural milieu. Despite the ambitious aims, a low level of professionalism in the editing board remained a problem and so did the lack of fervour as well as the passivity. Houdek openly expressed his deepest concern regarding the overall evolution of the Slovak activist landscape in a letter sent to Masaryk in November of 1901. “As a careful observer of our [Slovak] life, you certainly did not miss a sad fact: those who came back to Slovakia with the best ideas in their heart and full of moral fervour fell into lethargy, into moral and physical laziness. Some of them fell more slowly, others more rapidly.

The real reason though is that during the last period, the <span style="font-style:italic">Hlas</span> sailed into the waters of the clericals and, as a consequence, the youth educated in the spirit of the Czech realism turned away from him [Šrobár].”<span id="ftn21_return"><a class="notelink" title="Šrobár to Masaryk, 16 December 1902. – Rychlík, ed., Korespondence, 81, 82." href="#ftn21"><sup>20</sup></a></span> In addition, the administration of the review was something of a mess, subscriptions went partly unpaid and distribution remained poor.<span id="ftn22_return"><a class="notelink" title="SNA, of. Blaho, c. 52, No. 1706 to 1708.

The emergence of new cities and regions started to act as a counterweight to Martin’s influence.

Nevertheless, the network slowly grew. The year 1904 saw the first peak of education activities in the West, including conferences about alcoholism and dairy farming, and more than 20 conferences on other local or global economic questions and various topics of popular education, as well as the amateur theatre, which was an important and already developed part of the inclusive work on a local basis. This dynamic spread to agricultural cooperatives, from the Skalica cooperative to smaller structures in the surrounding areas. At the same time, small municipal libraries were opened, sometimes in private houses, and sometimes with the help of the Slovak catholic clergy that played an important role in the West. The third important step, as far as the West was concerned, was the opening of the House of the Peasant on the main Skalica square in 1905. The House, which was initiated by Blaho, soon transformed Skalica into the capital city of the Slovak peasantry.<span id="ftn24_return"><a class="notelink" title="SNA, of. Blaho, c. 47, No. 1559-1590." href="#ftn24"><sup>23</sup></a></span> Skalica became the place of the “Peasants’ congress”, an event that, each year from 1906 onwards, lasted for three or four days and was filled with conferences on health, technical progress, and political and economic education. An important part of it was devoted to joint activities (and notably cautiously prepared lunches and walks). As time went by, the core of participants to this congress expanded, gradually including new activists attracted by what was becoming a proper challenge for the “old centre”, i.e. Martin.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>In the mid-1900s, Western Slovakia’s dynamic also relied on Pressburg’s renewed place in the overall patriotic landscape. The quite diverse city had a centre that blended the old families from the patriotic milieu and outsiders coming mostly from the surrounding Western counties. The old Štefanovič, Dérer, and another lawyer, Štefan Fajnor,<span id="ftn25_return"><a class="notelink" title="About the Fajnors and their importance in the second half of the 19th century, see for instance Štefan Janšák, Život Štefana Fajnora [The Life of Štef…" href="#ftn25"><sup>24</sup></a></span> went on to help in building and strengthening this network. Their sons and daughters, and some of their close friends (Anton Štefánek and Milan Ivanka for instance) carried on their work, alongside the leading Catholic priests such as Ferdinand Juriga<span id="ftn26_return"><a class="notelink" title="About Juriga and his implication in Slovak politics at that time, see mostly Miroslav Pekník, ed., Ferdinand Juriga. Ľudový smer slovenskej politiky […" href="#ftn26"><sup>25</sup></a></span> and a handful of young social democrats. They were all born in the period between 1876 and 1884. Famously, Jozef Dérer’s son, Ivan, who was introduced into politics through the Catholic circles which, as he explained in his unpublished memoirs, “had somehow built a close contact with the mass of people like nobody had before”<span id="ftn27_return"><a class="notelink" title="LA SNK, 85 C 33." href="#ftn27"><sup>26</sup></a></span>, benefited from the aura of his father, his closeness to the Štefanovič family (he was about to marry one of Štefanovič’s daughters) and a good relationships with the Fajnors. At that time, Štefanovič was at the top of his reputation, and had gone to Martin to head the Tatra banka, which was facing huge financial difficulties. As such, this unusual choice brought by an “outsider” to the Martin milieu was one of the clues to a new balance in the movement.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>The diversification of the Slovak press was another clue. It came from the Catholic initiatives but also from some of the prominent business families of the Liptov County (mainly the Stodolas and the Makovickýs), who financed the main projects. The classical scheme was the following: the contestations or new options were financed and supported by the elders and organized by the youth. Such press was far from being professional and many projects failed due to persistent dilettantism and regional or personal rivalries combined with weak readership. The financial weakness and dependency on a number of influential families who also had to keep a balanced position between the “old” and the “new” was a constant problem. Despite these weaknesses, the failed experience in the press business helped strengthen certain networks of the young generation who challenged the still-leading centre of Martin.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>For their part, both Blaho and Hodža gradually forged new tools to be utilised in the lower- and middle-class Slovak peasantry. Milan Hodža was one of the youngest active leaders in the very early 20<sup>th</sup> century. He was born in 1878 in Sučany, just a few kilometres from Martin, and belonged to the famous Hodža family; his great-uncle was one of the three Captains of the 1848 Slovak uprising and a long-time friend of Ľudovít Štúr. Milan was also the son of Sučany’s pastor, and, as such, an important figure in Turiec’s religious and cultural life. He studied in Kolozsvár and Budapest and soon started to pay great attention to the “national question”.<span id="ftn28_return"><a class="notelink" title="About that period, see the apologetic chapter written by Ivan Thurzo. – Ivan Thurzo and Alena Bartlová, Slovenský Perikles [The Slovak Pericles] (Brat…" href="#ftn28"><sup>27</sup></a></span> His first public activities were in journalism as he contributed to the <span style="font-style:italic">Slovenské listy</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Hlas</span>. In 1900, he became editor-in-chief of <span style="font-style:italic">Slovenský denník</span> and relatively soon started to focus more on the politics rather than journalism. Despite the deeply ambiguous positions, he mostly considered the old strategy of the Slovak National Party (SNS) a failure that left the Slovak people unable to face the Magyarization process. Influenced by the Czech “small work”, he openly considered that the SNS did not pay enough attention to social and economic quest, therefore causing severe stagnation. In his opinion, the “peasant question” was the one that had to be urgently resolved and, like Blaho, he paid huge attention to the situation of peasants. However, unlike Blaho, Hodža strove to remain in touch with the SNS and Martin in order to be elected into the party’s councils and to share the burden within them.<span id="ftn29_return"><a class="notelink" title="SNA, f. SNS, Kniha zápisníc." href="#ftn29"><sup>28</sup></a></span> Moreover, in 1903, he created the <span style="font-style:italic">Slovenský týždenník </span>weekly, which became an influential paper spreading agrarianism, taking advantage of the passing of the <span style="font-style:italic">Hlas</span> the following year. Active and skilful, Hodža was elected to the Parliament in Budapest in 1906. Building on this success, he strengthened his position in the party and pushed for the introduction of an “agrarian” chapter in its programme.<span id="ftn30_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ľubomír Lipták, dir., Politické strany na Slovensku (1860–1989) [The political Parties in Slovakia (1860–1989)] (Bratislava: Archa, 1992), 43." href="#ftn30"><sup>29</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">7</span>The building of agrarianism in Slovakia was a showcase of its internal tensions and divisions.<span id="ftn31_return"><a class="notelink" title="Vladimír Zuberec, “Formovanie slovenského národného hnutia v rokoch 1900–1918,” [The formation of the Slovak national movement, 1900–1918] Historický …" href="#ftn31"><sup>30</sup></a></span> The “agrarian” movement of Skalica, and as such Blaho, were sharply criticized by the SNS, which considered Blaho to excessively challenge its authority due to the movement’s own actions.

It is also worth noting that the geographical factor could be compared with the type of family connections that were at stake. The competition in projects for an economic organization of the Slovak peasantry became less aggressive at the eve of the 1910s.

It was made up of men born between 1865 and 1875. Some of them did not live in Martin or even Turiec and they shared their first political experiences in the large cities of Cisleithania, Prague and especially Vienna. The second generation included men born in the 1880s, who were often high up in the patriotic movement and based in its most important centres. They had benefited from the transformation of the industrial and business environment enabled by the economic rise of the Kingdom of Hungary during the “liberal” period<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> Those young men combined the high-level education, dynamic family networks and experience acquired abroad, where their “elders” surrounded them.

In his correspondence, Ivan Markovič summed up two important elements of the situation: firstly, the heritage of the <span style="font-style:italic">Hlas</span> and Šrobár; and secondly, the remaining problem of a narrow social and cultural base: “We observed that links inside the youth are weak, that we do not really know each other and that few people know us, and when we want to talk together, we have no place to do it.”<span id="ftn52_return"><a class="notelink" title="LA SNK, A 970, Markovič to Neckar, 24 September 1909." href="#ftn52"><sup>51</sup></a></span> His description of <span style="font-style:italic">Prúdy</span>’s aims recalls those of the <span style="font-style:italic">Hlas</span>: “It will have two functions: publicizing the spiritual fruits of the youth’s work and informing the youth on events, trends and opinions in the Slovak life […] in economics, in politics and also in literature, arts and science.”<span id="ftn53_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid." href="#ftn53"><sup>52</sup></a></span> He explained that the review should “reflect the spiritual life of the Slovak youth”,<span id="ftn54_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., 14 October 1909." href="#ftn54"><sup>53</sup></a></span> prepare ”fighting issues”<span id="ftn55_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ibid., 15 January 1910." href="#ftn55"><sup>54</sup></a></span> and also welcome elder fighters, as long as they challenge the conservative policy of Martin. In that respect, Markovič vehemently defends Šrobár’s contribution to the review in interesting terms that show the respect he earned in the young generation: “Šrobár’s article testifies that <span style="font-style:italic">Prúdy</span> would like to make space for any opinion, and even for the opinions of the elders [at that time Šrobár was 43 years old], as long as they relate to the youth, its work and its role.

Although this initiative was more elite-focused, it carefully resounded in all types of social politics and education activities during the following years. It was consciously devoted to underlining the impact of those actions and the manner in which its influence was spreading. Štefánek summed up the difference by using the classical Martin orientation: “Here, it was not only about diverging opinions or differences in work methods in general. It was not only what we call the fight of the youth against the eldest… but a fundamental transformation in political and working methods…”<span id="ftn57_return"><a class="notelink" title="LA SNK, 42 X 22." href="#ftn57"><sup>56</sup></a></span> In order to help this transformation, shares in <span style="font-style:italic">Prúdy</span> were offered from April<span style="color:FF0000"> </span>1910 in order to create a consortium to provide aid for the review and establish the “Prúdy’s Library” collection of popular and scientific booklets.<span id="ftn58_return"><a class="notelink" title="LA SNK, A 970, Markovič and PavlůPavlů, Bohdan (1883-1938) to Neckar, 4 April 1910." href="#ftn58"><sup>57</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">5</span>This was also when the first project for a Slovak “daily” newspaper actually succeeded. Interestingly, the initiative was a genuine blend of different generations that have previously been discussed. Hodža’s first attempts failed due to inexperience, weak resources and narrow audience. After his election in 1906, the need for a daily paper that would spread political information emerged. The human and financial context in many ways facilitated the project. Amongst others, Hodža, Bella, Ivan Daxner, Šrobár, Ľudovít Medvecký, and Fedor Houdek took part in the final meeting of 21 November 1909 in Vrútky<span style="color:FF0000">. </span>The editorial board was to be headed by Hodža and Štefánek.<span id="ftn59_return"><a class="notelink" title="SNA, of.

These publishing initiatives lasted long enough to structure the political debate until the breakout of war. Besides the already mentioned activists, various circles with the same background were strengthened by these initiatives, as were their experience, networks and ability to shake up the old SNS. However, the latter remained dominant and almost unchallenged as the structure that was to unite “the different orientations of the nation”.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">6</span>Apart from a few exceptions, all of the main figures had fathers or forefathers who were members of the main cultural associations, very frequently board members, and a huge majority of them were subscribers to the main Slovak press editions, shareholders or guarantors in their publishing houses, shareholders in Slovak banks or holders of reciprocal stakes in their businesses.

To go deeper on this aspect, see another illustration in: Ján Hrušovský…" href="#ftn61"><sup>60</sup></a></span> and played a decisive role in the evolution of the new party programme in 1913.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">7</span>In conclusion, there are three points that should be highlighted. Firstly, the transformation of the action and ideological references in the active fraction of the patriotic movement included a shift in its geographical centres and external influences – mostly from the Czech Lands. It is worth noting that, save for a few exceptions, none of them originated from Martin. This is a first clue to the decreasing influence of the city and its institutions in favour of the neighbouring cities in the Liptov area and Western Slovakia. Secondly, challenging the classical politics of Martin did not necessarily mean breaking with its heritage. Most of the young activists simply could not conceive acting without at least a tacit agreement from the “capital city”, i.e. Martin; in the first part of the 1910s, they even accumulated enough influence and support to join its structures and eventually play a decisive part in drawing up its renewed programme in 1913. This inclusion in party politics is partly due to the idea in which unity had to prevail in an otherwise unfavourable cultural and political atmosphere. In many cases, newcomers used the same tools as their elders in the mid-1890s. Finally, the relationships they developed with their Czech counterparts – as they obviously benefited from their stays in Prague – created some common solidarities that allowed easier cooperation during the First World War and enabled them to play a leading role in the internal shift towards the Czechoslovak project in 1918. This shift was accelerated by the war, the growing contestation of the Party’s passive position, and political opportunity. Moreover, those involved in the <span style="font-style:italic">Hlas</span> and their “heirs” at the <span style="font-style:italic">Prúdy</span> took a firm lead in the Slovak politics at the end of 1918, as five out of 15 members of the first provisional Slovak government of December 1918 belonged to the <span style="font-style:italic">Hlas</span> first editorial board, while a handful of others were involved in the <span style="font-style:italic">Prúdy</span> and various circles active in the “small social work”, including the cooperatives or support to Slovak youth. Most of these men, who steeped in the history and contradictions of patriotic action, would become the backbone of (Czecho-)Slovak politics throughout the interwar period. The depth of their connections as well as their shared “Hungarian period” history, solidarities and hatred are one of the many keys that can help observe the first Czechoslovak Republic and the Slovak role therein.</p></div><!--TEI back--><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-back.1_div.1"><h2><span class="head">Sources and Literature</span></h2><div class="listhead">Archive sources:</div><ul><li class="item">SNA, BA – Slovak National Archive, Bratislava:<ul><li class="item">Personal collection Blaho.</li><li class="item">Personal collection Houdek.</li><li class="item">Personal collection Šrobár.</li><li class="item">SNS, Kniha zápisníc.</li></ul></li><li class="item">LA SNK, Martin – Literary archive, Slovak National Library, Martin :<ul><li class="item">A 970.

Zdi se, da so bile ožja družina in prijateljske vezi enako učinkovite kot v prejšnjih desetletjih, ko so prav tako krepile vezi med aktivisti.
