Namen tega prispevka je raziskati, kako so takratni irski poročevalci dojemali vprašanje urejanja mej v Srednji Evropi, s čimer omogoča vpogled v preoblikovanje političnega prostora na Irskem in v Srednji Evropi.

Newspaper editorials, journal articles and diplomatic accounts illustrate that post-war Ireland had an open attitude toward the settlement of borders on the Continent as the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was similarly controversial. This paper aims to investigate how contemporary Irish commentators perceived the question of boundary settlements in Central Europe in order to provide an insight into the transformation of political space in both Ireland and Central Europe. After providing a brief background to the Irish boundary question, this paper touches upon the most important points in historiography with regard to border settlements in the post-World War I era.. It also discusses Irish Partition history in detail, concentrating on the North-Eastern Boundary Bureau (NEBB) and the Boundary Commission, and the importance of Central European precedents in their work. Moreover, this paper also proposes to provide an insight into the Irish interest in the minority problem in European borderland regions after 1925 in order to illustrate the outward-looking attitude to Irish nationalists, even in relation to borders and minorities.</span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span><span style="font-style:italic">Keywords: Irish border, plebiscites, transnational history, Central Europe, Partition</span></p></div><!--TEI body--><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">Introduction</span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>The period from 1919 to 1922 saw the transformation of political order in Ireland, while the right to self-determination and independence remained in the centre of Irish political rhetoric. With the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence and the opening of the Fist Dáil Éireann in January 1919, the relationship between Ireland and Britain deteriorated. Political changes in Ireland were accompanied by personnel changes in the informal Irish diplomatic service; “roaming” Sinn Féin envoys were entrusted with disseminating propaganda on the Continent and gaining recognition for the independent Irish republic. After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921, due to opposition to the oath of allegiance required of Dáil members and provisions for ongoing links with Britain, a spilt occurred in the Irish republican movement. The Irish Free State, separate from Northern Ireland (established by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920), was a dominion within the British Empire, with legislative independence. The Treaty only provided a partial achievement and a full Republic was only declared decades later, gaining full formal sovereignty for twenty-six counties in 1949.<span id="ftn2_return"><a class="notelink" title="Robert Lynch, Revolutionary Ireland, 1912–25 (London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2015), 1.

Although the circumstances were different in Ireland and in Central Europe, the question of border revisions in the Danube basin sparked the interest of Irish contemporaries. When historian Patrick Keatinge described Ireland as “a revisionist small state, both in respect of the constitutional relationship with Britain and of partition [that] gave added edge to the Irish attitude of anti-imperialism in the nineteen-twenties and thirties”, he identified common ground between Ireland and other small states in Central Europe based on the revision of treaties (the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the Versailles Peace Treaties, respectively).<span id="ftn8_return"><a class="notelink" title="Patrick Keatinge, A Place among the Nations: Issues of Irish Foreign Policy (Dublin: Institute of Public Administration, 1978), 172." href="#ftn8"><sup>7</sup></a></span> Correspondingly, in more recent historiography, Michael Kennedy has confirmed that interwar Ireland “was siding with the ‘revisionist states’”, urging the revision of the post-war Paris Peace Treaties and constructing Irish foreign policy as part of the post-Versailles world order.<span id="ftn9_return"><a class="notelink" title="Michael Kennedy, “Chicanery and Candour: The Irish Free State and the Geneva Protocol, 1924-5,” Irish Historical Studies vol. xxix, No. 115 (May 1995)…" href="#ftn9"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>From the end of October 1918, the Irish press provided much coverage of how the Austrian empire was broken up.

The establishment of an Austrian republic was also noticed in Irish journals and newspapers due to the state’s overwhelmingly Catholic traditions. In addition, Irish interest was apparent in articles regarding the political turmoil in independent Hungary as well.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">4</span>J. J. Lee, who has compared Irish socio-economic and political developments with the case of other small states in his book <span style="font-style:italic">Ireland 1912-1985</span> (1990), has also pointed out the differences between post-war border disputes in Ireland and Central Europe. Lee has emphasised that after the Great War “borders were revised in central and eastern Europe in favour of smaller states. This was precisely what did not happen in Fermanagh and Tyrone.”<span id="ftn12_return"><a class="notelink" title="J. J.

He concluded that since the 1801 Act of Union was still in effect, in partitioning Ireland, “… the British legislature was establishing a new boundary within part of the United Kingdom over which it exercised the same political control as it did over the other parts. The boundary settlements in Central and Eastern Europe, in contrast, were the result of external interference with the territorial integrity of states which found themselves on the losing side in the First World War.”<span id="ftn16_return"><a class="notelink" title="Paul Murray, The Irish Boundary Commission and its Origins 1886–1925 (Dublin: UCD Press, 2011), 299." href="#ftn16"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">Partition history: the North-East Boundary Bureau and the Boundary Commission</span></h2><p><span class="numberParagraph">1</span>As it has been established in the Introduction, the struggle between unionists and nationalists over the Home Rule question had been part of political debates before the Great War. However, it was the Government of Ireland Act of 1920 that eventually sought to create two states, Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, and establish two parliaments (the southern parliament envisaged did not materialise and Home Rule, which was granted to both, took effect only in the north).<span id="ftn17_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ged Martin, “The Origins of Partition,” in: The Irish Border: History, Politics, Culture, eds.

In the case of the latter, a Boundary Commission would be established to amend the (presently provisional) border between Northern Ireland (still part of the United Kingdom) and the Irish Free State (gained dominion status). The “Provisional-Government-sponsored” North-Eastern Boundary Bureau (NEBB - October 1922) and then the Boundary Commission (first met in November 1924) were to make a decision “in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants, so far as may be compatible with economic and geographic conditions.”<span id="ftn18_return"><a class="notelink" title="Michael Kennedy, Division and Consensus: The Politics of Cross-Border Relations in Ireland 1925–1969 (Dublin: Institute of Public Administration, 2000…" href="#ftn18"><sup>17</sup></a></span> First and foremost, before discussing the cases of European boundary commissions, the Memorandum on the European Precedents for the NEBB declared that: “it must be remembered that in Ireland a boundary has already been drawn through the disputed areas, such as did not exist in Europe.

In the city of Sopron/Oedenburg a plebiscite (December 1921) decided in favour of staying under the Hungarian state. The plebiscite was attacked by many (non-Magyar) contemporaries, and was later questioned by historians. Throughout the conflict, the Irish press, relying on Reuters cablegrams from Berlin and telegrams from Vienna, echoed the Austrian opinion.<span id="ftn25_return"><a class="notelink" title="“Just another War Front.

The file compiled in relation to the northern Hungarian border and the question of the Ruthenian minority was actually a copy of the Czechoslovak memorandum presented at the Paris Peace Conference. Therefore, it reflected the arguments of the Czechoslovak Republic, claiming the territory inhabited by Ruthenians in the north-eastern part of the former Dual Monarchy. The Czechoslovak memorandum stressed that: “the Ruthenians of Hungary, a nation closely related to the Slovaks, live under the same conditions as the Slovaks, that they are in very intimate relation with them, that their union to the Czecho-Slovak Republic would cause no difficulty whatever. 2.

Nevertheless, Eda Sagarra has pointed out that the phrasing of Article 12 of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and its interpretation by the Free State is “to be understood in the context of the plebiscitary politics of post-war Central Europe, notably as laid down in the Treaties of Versailles and Trianon”, referring to Upper Silesia, Klagenfurt, Burgenland, North Schleswig, and East Prussia.<span id="ftn28_return"><a class="notelink" title="Sagarra, Kevin O’Shiel, 205." href="#ftn28"><sup>27</sup></a></span> As the Austro-Hungarian Empire was defeated in the Great War, their successors’ claims were treated differently by the great powers at and after Versailles than the victorious, newly independent small nations in the region. Therefore, when the Irish commission was looking for a precedent to support Irish nationalist demands, they rather examined the appeals of previously successful small states. Altogether, the very fact that the question of boundaries was in dispute created a greater Irish interest in territorial settlements in Europe.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">7</span>In post-war Europe, there was no guarantee that the political boundaries were about to reflect ethnic boundaries; indeed, when it came to the boundary issue in Ireland, eventually, no plebiscite was held, despite the research done by the NEBB and the personal experience of, for instance, F. B. Bourdillon, Secretary of Irish Boundary Commission, former member of the Upper Silesian Commission (1920-22).<span id="ftn29_return"><a class="notelink" title="NAI NEBB/4/5/2, Copy of Letter from Hugh A.

It was visible that “the Treaty of Versailles was not a heaven-sent document, to be regarded forever as rigid and inviolable. On the contrary,” argued the<span style="font-style:italic">Irish Press;</span> “it was – like the ‘Treaty’ forced on us – a settlement based on compulsion and an attempt to perpetuate the spoils system in its delimitation of frontiers.”<span id="ftn31_return"><a class="notelink" title="“Europe’s Problems,” Irish Press, September 26, 1935." href="#ftn31"><sup>30</sup></a></span> Echoing de Valera’s agenda and ideas about “peaceful revision”, placing the Irish question in parallel with other European small nations, the paper claimed: “…We in Ireland have more than an academic interest in this question. Ireland is one of the small nations which for centuries has endured oppression at the hands of powerful neighbouring State. […] Revision and readjustment must come, if there is to be lasting peace in the world […].

Therefore, this paper hoped to highlight the significance of the wider international context when investigating the Irish border question in the early interwar years. It aimed to illustrate Irish awareness of the political transformation of Central Europe and territorial settlements after the Great War, with special attention the plebiscites in Upper Silesia and Klagenfurt, also emphasising the significance the League of Nations, particularly after the failure of the Boundary Commission. Consequently, even though the Boundary Commission failed to alter the Irish border, the history of its work should be viewed as part of a larger European narrative.</p></div><!--TEI back--><div class="bibliography" id="index.xml-back.1_div.1"><h2><span class="head">Sources and Literature</span></h2><div class="listhead">Archive Sources:</div><ul><li class="item">NAI, National Archives of Ireland:<ul><li class="item">Department of Finance Files - FIN/1/2168.</li><li class="item">North-Eastern Boundary Bureau Files, NEBB/2/1/10, NEBB/2/1/11, NEBB/2/1/12, NEBB/2/1/13, NEBB/4/5/2.</li></ul></li><li class="item">UCDA, University College Dublin Archives:<ul><li class="item">Eoin MacNeill Papers, LA1/H/61, LA1/H/83, LA1/H/89, LA1/H/95.</li><li class="item">Patrick McGilligan Papers, P35b/132 (28), P35b/133.</li></ul></li></ul><div class="listhead">Archive Sources (Online):</div><ul class="listBibl"><li id="index.xml-bibl-d30e563"><div class="biblfree">NAI DE 2/304/1, National Archives of Ireland, Dáil Éireann Files, <span style="font-style:italic">Documents on Irish Foreign Policy</span> [<span style="font-style:italic">DIFP</span>] vol. ii.

Po podpisu versajskih mirovnih pogodb so bile novozačrtane meje v Srednji Evropi deležne precej pozornosti tudi v irski javnosti in časopisju, ne samo v tamkajšnjih političnih krogih. Prelomni točki v irskem mejnem vprašanju sta predstavljala zakon o vladi Irske (Government of Ireland Act) iz leta 1920, v skladu s katerim naj bi na irskem otoku nastali dve državi, in angleško-irski sporazum (Anglo-Irish Treaty), ki je omogočil novoustanovljeni državi Severni Irski ločitev od Svobodne države Irske. Sčasoma sta bila ustanovljena Urad za severovzhodno mejo (NEBB – oktobra 1922) in pozneje še Mejna komisija (novembra 1924), da bi popravila (prvo začasno) mejo med Severno Irsko in Svobodno državo Irsko v skladu z "željami prebivalcev".</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">2</span>Za utemeljitev zahtev je Urad za severovzhodno mejo preučil podobne dogovore o mejah v povojni Evropi. Direktor Kevin O’Shiel, raziskovalec Bolton C. Waller in sekretar Edward Millington Stephens so bili ključni akterji pri raziskovanju in odločanju. Poleg tega so bile zelo pomembne tudi osebne izkušnje F. B. Bourdillona, sektretarja Mejne komisije za Irsko, nekdanjega člana Komisije za Gornjo Šlezijo (1920–22), saj je lahko primerjal celinske dogovore z irskimi okoliščinami. Urad za severovzhodno mejo in Mejna komisija sta posvetila precej pozornosti plebiscitom zaradi poudarjenega pomena "želj prebivalcev" tudi v irskem primeru. Zato so se Uradu zdeli pomembni plebisciti na naslednjih ozemljih: v Gornji Šleziji (marec 1921); v Schleswigu (februar-marec 1920); in v Celovcu na jugovzhodu avstrijske Koroške (oktober 1920). Kljub temu pa na Irskem ni bilo plebiscita in tudi meja med Severno Irsko in Svobodno državo Irsko se ni spremenila, saj so bile obstoječe meje potrjene 3. decembra 1925, potem ko je britanski časopis <span style="font-style:italic">Morning Post</span> 7. novembra 1925 razkril načrtovane premike meja. Kljub neuspehu Mejne komisije pa je mogoče ugotoviti, da se vprašanje meja na Irskem ni obravnavalo osamljeno, ampak je bilo del širše evropske zgodbe.</p><p><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Najpomembnejša posledica Mejne komisije za Irsko je bilo okrepljeno irsko sodelovanje v Društvu narodov glede na vlogo, ki jo je ta organizacija imela v zaščiti etničnih in verskih manjših. Irski nacionalisti so si torej tudi za razpravo o ozemeljskih zahtevah, reviziji in pravicah manjših izbrali širši mednarodni oder, kjer so predstavili svoje zahteve in pogosto razpravljali o drugih dogovorih glede meja na celini. Na splošno je cilj tega prispevka prikazati, kako se je zgolj zaradi dejstva, da je bilo vprašanje meja sporno, povečalo irsko zanimanje za ozemeljske dogovore v Evropi, kar pomeni, da neodvisna Irska ni bila vase zagledana država, za kakršno je veljala pred tem.</p></div><!--Notes in [TEI]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Opombe</div><div class="note" id="ftn1"><span class="noteLabel">* </span><div class="noteBody">PhD, National University of Ireland, Galway University Road, Galway, Ireland; <a class="link_ref" href="l.zach1@nuigalway.ie%C2%A0">l.zach1@nuigalway.ie</a></div> <a class="link_return" title="Go back to text" href="#ftn1_return">↵</a></div><div class="note" id="ftn2"><span class="noteLabel">1. </span><div class="noteBody">Robert Lynch, <span style="font-style:italic">Revolutionary Ireland, 1912–25</span> (London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2015), 1.
